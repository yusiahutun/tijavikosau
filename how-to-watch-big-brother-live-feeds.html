It must be unsettling and make them question what’s happening and why? Let the speculation and paranoia begin! This is Big Brother!” she said.</p><p>She also told Entertainment Weekly about what her Big Brother strategy would be if she was Cirie. “You quietly observe and don’t talk about your achievements on Survivor or the experience at all. Act like a newbie in the house because it’s a whole different ball game,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Chen also revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in July 2023 that she wasn’t the first choice to be the Big Brother host. The role was originally offered to journalist Meredith Vieria who turned it down. “I wasn’t the first choice to host. It was offered and turned down by Meredith Vieira,” she said. Her husband, CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves, confirmed to her that Vieria was the first choice. “I asked him. I said, ‘You know, I heard stories back when I was cast on Big Brother to host that you guys asked Meredith Vieira first.’ And he said it was true,” she said. “He said, ‘I knew Big Brother was going to be kind of a trashy show… So, we wanted to class it up with the host,'” she says, adding that “they offered it to her because she was a very well-respected name in the business.”</p><p>Chen explained that Vieria turned down the job of Big Brother to become the host of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in 2002. Chen, who was an anchor on CBS Morning News at the time Big Brother was looking for a host, also told Entertainment Tonight that her ties to the network helped her score the job. “So I was ‘in house,'” she said. “And when they offered me the job, they were one month away from launching the show.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, “I know that I was meant to host Big Brother. I was terrible in the beginning. [But] I’ve grown so much as a human being and as a host… And I love it. I can’t imagine not hosting Big Brother anymore.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-s-the-big-brother-25-host>Who’s the Big Brother 25 host?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Big-Brother-25-3.jpg><p>The Big Brother 25 host is Julie Chen, who has hosted Big Brother since Season 1 in 2000. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in July 2023, Chen opened up about how long she plans to host Big Brother. I look at my joints. I look at, ‘how do my hips and my knees feel this morning?'” she said. “I like to take one season at a time. Going into season 25, I’m like, ‘I never want it to end.’ I think there would have to be a few things [to make me step away], like if I feel like the public is getting tired of me or the show is not what I want it to be. But with [executive producers] Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan leading the way, I can’t imagine it ever being something that I feel is not in alignment with me or what the show should be in my mind.”</p><p>She continued, “I think you know when it’s time to go, whether as a show or me as a host, and I just don’t see signs of that right now. But you just never know.”</p><p>She also revealed during the interview who she would want to replace her as the host if Big Brother went on for 50 seasons. “I don’t know if I’m going to still be on it because I don’t know if I’m still going to be alive,” she said. “I would love to pass it on to my son. Not that he has any interest in hosting, but you know, keep it in the family, Big Brother!”</p><p>Big Brother Season 25 is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paramount Plus</a>.
