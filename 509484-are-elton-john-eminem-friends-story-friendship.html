The stars of the show were the hardcore and talented rapper Eminem and the music legend Elton John who often sings soft rock. It was a convergence of two pop icons with different personas and ideologies, and their on-stage chemistry was remarkable. It is over two decades since that performance that, in the eyes of fans, started something special between the two superstars. So, are Elton John and Eminem friends?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/478bc358fd04b0dd.jpeg><p class=align-left>Fascinating. A rapper who has always been accused of being homophobic is friends with Elton John. It is unfathomable. But circumstances appear different, and the two superstars, Eminem and Elton John, have had an interesting relationship over the years. What is the relationship between Elton John and Eminem?</p><h2>When did Eminem and Elton John first meet?</h2><p class=align-left>The iconic appearance and performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards began Elton John and Eminem's <a href=#>friendship</a>. Therefore, everything started at the 2001 Grammy Awards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a18058e6166c5167.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Khaligraph Jones, Nadia Bash Eric Omondi for Always Criticising Musicians: "We Can't Take You Seriously"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The two <a href=#>multitalented musicians</a> performed one of Eminem’s biggest hits, <i>Stan</i>, initially recorded by British singer Dido and released on November 21, 2000. The song is about an Eminem fan with repressed gay tendencies who turns homicidal.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, the performance of Elton and Eminem was entirely unexpected. Eminem has long been faced with controversy because of his lyrics supporting violence, misogyny, and homophobia.</p><p class=align-left>The musicians held hands after the performance, signalling a start of a good friendship.</p><h2>Are Elton John and Eminem friends?</h2><p class=align-left>The biggest question everyone has been asking about Eminem and Elton John is, “Are Eminem friends with Elton?” Yes, they are good friends. During an interview session on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Graham Norton Show</a>, Elton John had kind words about his relationship with Eminem, showing that they are great friends and hot a homophobe, as most people thought.</p>We became friends. We’ve been amazing friends ever since. He’s an amazing guy. […] I just adore him.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faf90c9caa8740e8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Renowned 83-Year-Old Actor Al Pacino's Girlfriend 8 Months Pregnant with&nbsp;His&nbsp;4th&nbsp;Child</span></p></a><p class=align-left>An exciting thing about Eminem’s first meet-up with Elton John is that he did not even know he was openly gay. He expressed his opinion during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MTV News</a> in 2004.</p>Of course, I heard of Elton John. I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care. But being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself, saying that he understood where I was coming from.<h2>Why did Eminem and Elton John perform together?</h2><p class=align-left>One thing about popular awards is that the organisers always look to make it an unforgettable experience. And since the Grammy is famous for flashy, unusual <a href=#>musical pairings</a>, Eminem and Elton John were the perfect choice.</p><p class=align-left>Eminem was slated to perform at the Grammys, which was unfathomable considering his strong opinions. And he needed a partner for his performance. During his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">negotiation with the organisers</a>, Eminem joked that he would perform at the Grammys only if it were with Elton John.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e259d6e37bb73706.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MAFS New Orleans cast profiles: Where are the couples now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since it was an idea out of this <a href=#>world</a>, considering their divergent genres and points of view, they went with it.</p><h2>Is Elton John Eminem’s sponsor?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a18058e6166c5167.jpg><p class=align-left>To answer the question, “How did Elton John and Eminem become friends?” you must look at where they connect. It is no secret that Eminem has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suffered from addiction</a>. He has mentioned it various times in interviews. The habit was so severe that the <a href=#>gifted rapper </a>almost died and had to take up to 30 Vicodin daily. But did you know that Elton John was integral to Eminem’s recovery?</p><p class=align-left>During an interview with The Guardian in 2009, Eminem had the following to say about the help he received from Elton John during his recovery battle.</p>When I first wanted to get sober, I called [Elton] and spoke to him about it. He's somebody who's in the business and can identify and relate to the lifestyle and how hectic things can be. He understands…the pressure and any other areas you want to come up with for doing illegal medicine. I reached out to him and told him, 'Look, I'm going through a problem, and I need your advice.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1879e1a5a1ea0d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Was there meant to be a Back to the Future 4? All the details</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eminem has also opened up about how Elton John used to call him frequently during his recovery to follow up on his progress.</p><h2>Eminem’s gift to Elton John</h2><p class=align-left>During the Graham Norton Show, Elton John openly talked about his friendship with Eminem and even stated that the rapper gifted him something interesting in 2005. He sent the gift when Elton John and his partner marked their civil partnership.</p><p class=align-left>In the show, Elton stated that the gift showed how much homophobic he is not, contrary to what many people assume. Over a decade later, Ed Sheeran gifts the same thing to Sam Smith. And the inspiration for the six-foot marble statue he sent to Sam Smith came from the unholy gift Eminem sent to Elton.</p><h2>Did Eminem sample Elton John?</h2><p class=align-left>Eminem sampled Elton John’s song in 1971, song <i>Indian Sunset</i>. He used it in the late American rapper Tupac Shakur’s song, <i>Ghetto Gospel,</i> released as the lead single from his 2004 posthumous album, <i>Loyal to <a href=#>the Game</a></i>. The song was produced by the American rapper Eminem.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/24a8ab896348007e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are Mitch and Tina still together after their second breakup?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Elton John and Eminem are great friends.
