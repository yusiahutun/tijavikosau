However, finding a comfortable bra isn’t as easy as just grabbing a soft-looking T-shirt bra at your local mall. Poking underwires, compressive cups, and suffocating straps can take a bra from hero to zero in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not anymore. We tested 27 of the best bras for women in search of the ones that we actually wanted to wear all day long. After living in them for three weeks and making sure we accounted for a wide range of bra sizes and styles, we found 13<strong> </strong>bras that gently held us in (and up) with soft, oh-so-touchable material. Ditch the old bras you’ve been suffering in for way too long—these are the most comfortable bras you can possibly find.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-bra-overall-cuup-the-scoop-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable Bra Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuup Scoop Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuup The Scoop Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kghuWy3Tr3aJEZR2-mRTT6etSqo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cuup-the-scoop-bra-c74c6573e39a4968a5485ce828b8e7e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>CUUP</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not to be dramatic, but this might possibly be the most comfortable bra we ever tried on. Regardless of cup size, this bra made our girls look perky, while feeling practically weightless. To begin, the material feels (and looks) impossibly soft. The combination of polyamide and elastane gives it a satiny finish and allows it to lay flat against the chest with no gaping. It molded to our bodies as if it was custom-made for us. And while it didn’t have any padding or push-up, it still managed to give us a nice lift and support, thanks to the underwire (which, by the way, never poked us or dug into our skin) — even on our bottom-heavy breasts. The adjustable straps, albeit a little short on our longer torsos, never dug into our shoulders either.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As big-chested women, we typically deal with a little spillage over the top of the bra, but this one provided just the right amount of coverage. Without providing too much coverage (you know, those grandma-looking bras us big-chested girls come across far too often), this bra managed to cover, hold, and support while looking absolutely stunning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Underneath our shirts, the thin fabric blended in so seamlessly, you would have thought it was skin. That being said, there is no nipple protection on the cups, so a little cold breeze immediately showed the shape of our nipples. If that bothers you, a thicker tee or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nipple covers</a> will certainly remedy the solution because we don’t think that’s worth skipping this bra for that reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30A–44H<strong> | Colors: </strong>12 <strong>| Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2688 data-sizes=750px alt="CUUP the Scoop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TIltFoU1jsm1m-lowFsyOOBdOrU=/fit-in/1500x2688/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-cuup-scoop-shannon-bauer-02-b3815a465fc9448c9e1518348840ab4e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2673 data-sizes=750px alt="CUUP the Scoop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QkPuS2fJqmql-y4mc4Fs_D0hecM=/fit-in/1500x2673/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-cuup-scoop-shannon-bauer-01-fa1741f2e87a4858bb0f4488508e74f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-breasts-pepper-classic-all-you-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Small Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pepper All You Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pepper Classic All You Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ywz46n2Ow037jaWfrw3KeAYKsmQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pepper-classic-all-you-bra-2aa83a5341384b6497fc1c8fc1f7e70f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pepper</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bras for small breasts</a> that actually fit and won't gape or shift? Pepper specifically creates bras for small boobs (from cup sizes AA to B). Color us impressed, because upon placing the bra against our A-cupped chest, we were elated to find it sat flat against our rib cage, shoulder width, and cups. There was no gaping, which is easily the number one problem small chests have with bras. &nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option has a styled mesh layer over the bra, connected to a delicate strap that pulls the cup upward and keeps the material flat against the chest. While we did notice that the texture shows ever so slightly underneath tight-fitting shirts, other tops don’t give away to the bra at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of fitting like a glove, we loved how incredibly soft the fabric felt. Both the mesh overlay and the smooth band felt extremely comfortable against the skin on top of being quite sturdy; we never had to worry about them potentially snagging or pulling when they came into contact with zippers, jewelry, or nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30AA-40B<strong> | Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unlined-negative-sieve-demi-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unlined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Negative Sieve Demi Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Sieve Demi Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qY51hCKaxaje72qv1uWQvzrreis=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Negative-Sieve-Demi-Bra-601c53965bd2464a8e58fee641aa4c80.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Negative</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we're talking about an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>unlined bra</a> that's just the right balance between minimal and structured, we can't rave enough about this beauty. There is an underwire, which curves along the cups and comes up to around our armpits, ensuring our breasts don’t slip out of the side. Made of sheer Belgian power micromesh, the bra blew us away with how much support it gave our breasts for how thin of a material it is. While mesh bras typically don’t work on our big chests, this, combined with the strap positioning coming up the sides of our decolletage, held them up like it was no big feat. Simply put, it was love at first wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, the mesh fabric, however strong and sturdy, is see-through. Without any extra padding, our nipples were on full display. It’s also not the most soft material we tried on, given its net-like texture, but we didn’t notice any irritation on our skin. When we covered it with a simple shirt (even a white one), we saw no signs of our areolas. The bra felt so natural on our skin that upon leaving the house, we experienced a mild panic thinking we forgot to put on a bra. And while we typically strip our bras off immediately after returning home, we were happy to spend the rest of the day lounging around in this beauty until it was time to shower – that’s how effortless it felt. The material of the bra was simply sublime, and despite how breathable and second-skin it felt like, it never gave up on support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B-40G<strong> | Colors: </strong>4<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=849 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Sieve Demi Bra" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/li5wYFQTdrn8HLwCyowkLfGNUGI=/fit-in/1500x849/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-negative-sieve-demi-ivy-ford-01-4d72dc866bf747c5a8f1bacd1bc1efc5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=853 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Sieve Demi Bra" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jbOKaXxPCo--xAgjijaS6EUNpZ8=/fit-in/1500x853/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-negative-sieve-demi-ivy-ford-02-9cdbf855fbca401a8a866e89ae77dbb4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-thirdlove-247-second-skin-unlined-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thirdlove 24/7 Second Skin Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thirdlove 24/7 Second Skin Unlined Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HKH5co9s3qnMPnrKGshrgNyBlu0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thirdlove-247-second-skin-unlined-bra-3bca5f8b79b542b594c2a2e790e91fda.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thirdlove</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before we dive into the ins and outs of this luscious bra, it should be noted that the cups are a sleek, thin material, not unlike a silky bralette, — not even the Cuup Scoop Bra, which we admit does look similar. This one, however, comes in half sizes as well. You’ll find a size A, as well as an A ½ to cover a wider range of chest sizes. The luxurious, unpadded fabric provided full coverage, blending into the straps and smoothing over our shoulders in a triangular shape. The material didn’t pill, stretch, or shrink after a wash, which was a huge relief. Underneath it all was an underwire that went all the way up under our armpits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bra amazed us with how much it truly felt like second-skin. Rather than providing a significant amount of support, it beautifully molded into the natural shape of our breasts. We never noticed any spillage – at least not on our bottom-heavy chest. Instead, the material pressed around our body, tucking us into its soft material with care. Unfortunately, there are no customizable features on this bra, as the straps are neither adjustable nor removable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s typically hard to find non-padded bras for larger chests, but this one simply left us speechless.

With nine nude colors to choose from, it was easier than usual to find a piece that camouflaged with our skin and under our shirts. Not only that, but the barely-there bra was so comfortable, we even slept in it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking at the bra straight out of the box (and on the image model), we were worried that the coverage would be far too much. However, once on, we were surprised to find them have mid-range coverage — and it didn’t overwhelm us with fabric. The band portion was on the thicker side, which helped give it the support it needed without the boning on the sides. But with the fabric being as thin as it was, it never felt too tight or uncomfortable. Overall, we found it to be soft, comfortable, and invisible under a shirt, giving us a traditional bra – with underwire, adjustable straps, and back clasps – without the bulk.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, the sizing begins to falter on larger bust sizes. We’ve experienced this before when we tested their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shapewear</a>, which ran far too small on more voluptuous bodies. Skims seems to run slightly smaller than average, particularly around the band. We noticed that the size guide isn’t all that accurate either, and required us to visit a professional bra fitter experienced with the Skims line to recommend the best sizing for us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30A-46H<strong> | Colors: </strong>9<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane <strong>| Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-supportive-wacoal-basic-beauty-spacer-underwire-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Supportive</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wacoal Basic Beauty T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wacoal Basic Beauty Spacer Underwire T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KDS74xn1Zd3ldKcVUP-XwVqUEFs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wacoal-basic-beauty-spacer-underwire-t-shirt-bra-182b0a83380b445c91af34c1e117ea9a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wacoal</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re tired of feeling minimally supported by bras, especially when you want something particularly comfortable to wear, we think you’ll love this comfortable bra from Wacoal. The full coverage piece came with a variety of details that made it very supportive for our girls, making it a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>option for older women</a>. The band is quite wide and hugs the ribcage securely before leading into rather thick straps. The underwire loops all the way around the breast, preventing any underboob from spilling out, while stitching on the middle portion of the band sat higher up and closer together than the average bra. It’s a lot of fabric, but all of it is surprisingly soft and comfortable – so much so that we had no issue wearing it on an eight-plus hour flight and back to Europe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cups, straps, and band are all made of the same material, namely polyester, nylon, and spandex, and feel silky around the whole body. During the entire duration of having this bra on, we were securely held in place by its soft touch, sans push up or thick padding.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were also surprised to find that it disappeared underneath a shirt. Despite the little bow at the middle of the chest, nothing showed from under our clothes.

The option from Lively, as we tested it, not only camouflaged under our shirts, but felt invisible on as well. The demi-cups feature a satiny smooth surface that allowed our tops to just glide right over them. The band portion is rather unique on this one, as it comes with a thicker elastic strap that hugs the body in a comfortable yet secure way in order to eliminate the dreaded experience of having the band climb up the back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a relatively sturdy padding, our nipples were barred from poking through them. Over on the back side, we noticed the lace straps to never cause any irritation or itchy sensation. Surprisingly enough, we couldn’t spot them from under our shirts either. We were elated to find the length adjusters at the front of the bra strap, rather than the back, which made adjusting for size a delightful breeze. And as an added bonus, we loved the additional option to clasp the middle part together to create a racerback.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now if only our bigger chests weren’t left spilling over the cups, this would have been one of the best bras for women, full stop.

Light as air, soft as butter, and surprisingly supportive, the seamless bra felt like a combination of a traditional bra, a sports bra, and a bralette. The underwire sewn into the fabric is unlike any other we’ve tried on. It’s flexible, to start, moving with the body’s movement. And despite being very minimal – cupping just the underboob – its ability to remain flat against the ribs and keep the girls from falling down was splendid. It even passed our jumping and running test, holding our DDs back from bouncing too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from that one underwire, however, the bra is seamless. There’s no caging around the sides and the fabric, with its 30 percent elastane, stretches beautifully over the skin. We wore this bra for over twelve hours at a time with high activity (running around Venice and Milan), and the bra maintained its comfort and contour around the body. We only noticed the first few signs of the fabric fraying around the straps after the first wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the removable pads the most, though. When we wanted a little extra coverage, we had it, but we could easily achieve a little more freedom by simply removing them out from the bottom. Without them, the fabric is rather thin, so we could definitely see the nipples poking out if it got too cold. Nothing major on our small chests, but rather noticeable on our bigger ones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32A-36DDD<strong> | Colors: </strong>5<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>Removable</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=683 data-sizes=750px alt="Aerie Smoothez Unlined Bra" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CDANxR5mHNEME_2rC7w4xXmhL7E=/fit-in/1500x683/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-aerie-smoothez-unlimited-samantha-aronson-02-6645320a87ca4b03b1b2344dc9368786.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=683 data-sizes=750px alt="Aerie Smoothez Unlined Bra" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vjWPtICMHVdqgUVAuONhVRUXlEI=/fit-in/1500x683/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-comfortable-bras-test-aerie-smoothez-unlimited-samantha-aronson-01-e2dd2017acd44d2d8b66201213a33863.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-front-closure-spanx-bra-llelujah-lightly-lined-wireless-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Front Closure</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Bra-llelujah!

Because of the front clasp, this bra had a completely seamless back that gently smoothed out our skin. Both the straps and the band lay flat against our bodies and remained invisible under clothing. And while the straps are not adjustable in length, they are extra stretchy, and we never had a problem with them digging into our shoulders. We only wished they were slightly thinner, as the thickness made them somewhat difficult to pair with certain tops that have slimmer straps. On regular T-shirts, however, the smooth fabric was indetectable from underneath.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There is a little bit of padding in the cups — it’s not enough to call it push-up but just enough to add a little support to the girls. On our bigger chests, the extra padding never bothered us the way it typically does because rather than making our chests look unbearably large, they molded and lifted them to look round and perky.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Interestingly enough, we found the underwire slightly bothersome on our smaller chest. It felt almost too constrictive, digging into our chests and requiring us to adjust ourselves several times a day. As someone who typically refrains from wearing wired bras, it could simply be that we were no longer used to that sensation. Our larger chest never had an issue with the underwire, though.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32A-40DD <strong>| Colors: </strong>8<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wireless-true--co-soft-form-v-neck-adjustable-strap-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wireless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>True & Co.

And to our big-chested ladies, before you dismiss the concept of wireless bras completely, we’re here to tell you that this one impressed us.

Never did we deal with any spillage or slippage. The bra also came with removable padding, and we appreciated that we could alter support levels by keeping them in or taking them out. We did notice that on loose v-neck shirts, the top dipped too low and would show the ends of the bra poking our from underneath.

We therefore couldn’t adjust the band size around our ribcage either, which could be a problem for those with small backs but large breasts. But we could adjust the strap length around our shoulders. Overall, it fit quite comfortably, and on our smaller chests, we found this bra to work quite well as a sports bra, too, as we wore it straight to the gym one night after work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3XL <strong>| Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane<strong> | Padding: </strong>Optional</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-breasts-soma-intimates-embraceable-perfect-coverage-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Soma Intimates Perfect Coverage Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Soma Intimates Embraceable Perfect Coverage Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WMVQygJ7jvWQNfE4iyhpxy4gdCU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Soma-Intimates-Perfect-Coverage-Bra-4ced73b536c14534ad2edd2f4550dc60.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Soma</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a supportive, functional bra that fits comfortably without looking like it came straight out of your grandmother’s closet is difficult —but not impossible. At a first glance, we knew we would love this full-coverage, non-push up bra from Soma. We didn’t notice any upper or side spillage, thanks to the full round cups and underwire. Fairly thick straps offered our chests a good lift as well, without making them look too full.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bra was also extremely comfortable. It uses the same uniform fabric across the cups, band, and straps, which glided next to the skin and never caused any irritation. It made it perfect for everyday wear, and we found ourselves reaching for this bra over any other in our dresser. Despite being quite a substantial bra, with maximum coverage and lots of fabric, it somehow managed to feel fairly light and easygoing on the body. We only noticed that after a wash, the fabric, particularly around the straps, began to pill ever so slightly. Perhaps avoiding the dryer and hanging it after the wash (or opting for hand washing) would combat this issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B-42DDD<strong> | Colors: </strong>9<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex <strong>| Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-material-harper-wilde-base-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Material</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Harper Wilde Base T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Harper Wilde Base T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SDnMqudehJBIJ-47pfFBnE4cI3c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/harper-wilde-base-t-shirt-bra-7595e48154f7453fb598a9681ac02b24.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Harper Wilde</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The silky-smooth fabric felt like absolute bliss against our skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>One of our bras had a noticeable defect in the back band.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We fell head-over-heels for the material of the Harper Wilde Base T-Shirt Bra. The microfiber fabric—a signature of Harper Wilde bras—felt both smooth and smoothing on our skin. The bra lay super flat on our bodies, thanks to the seamless design, and we’d go so far as to say it felt like a pillow for our chest—yup, we went there. Even though this bra is full-coverage, it didn’t feel frumpy or matronly, and you couldn’t see a hint of its outline through our clothes. The Base isn’t padded, but it is partially lined, which only added to the cozy feeling. Bonus points for the front-adjustable straps, which made it easier than ever to find the perfect fit (without contorting like a Cirque du Soleil acrobat).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, while the fabric got perfect marks across the board, we were less impressed by the back band and its hooks (picture us sitting this bra down at the kitchen table and saying “we’re not angry, we’re just disappointed). One of the rear hooks began painfully digging into our backs—to the point where we had to Uber home and change mid-day. We’re pretty sure it’s a product defect and not the standard for this otherwise comfortable bra, but we’d recommend giving this area a thorough inspection before snipping tags off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32A-42DDD/F<strong> | Colors: </strong>10<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane <strong>| Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sexiest-design-natori-frame-full-fit-unlined-underwire-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Sexiest Design</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natori Frame Full Fit Unlined Underwire Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Natori Frame Full Fit Unlined Underwire Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RB3iFJe3Y4IT4HVdWlWFGVR1eMM=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Natori-Frame-Full-Fit-Unlined-Underwire-Bra-c52976c76c3c434eb1107cbbfbbd6e51.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Natori</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The gauzy mesh and delicate embroidery prove comfort and style can coexist in a bra.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It offered better support for a larger chest compared to a smaller chest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your average comfortable bra is like a 2009 Toyota Camry—totally reliable but not that cute— the Natori Frame Full Fit Unlined Underwire Bra is a Lamborghini. We gushed over the mesh cups and the feminine embroidery, which was sewn onto a stretchy tulle material to move with your body. The sexy design gave us a little boost of confidence while wearing this bra (but heads up, the mesh cups are unlined and the embroidery will peek out under a t-shirt). We were also delighted by the soft, buttery texture of the band, which was one of the most comfortable ones we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After comparing notes between our B cup and D cup wearers, we’d recommend this most to wearers with larger cup sizes. On a smaller chest, the underwire didn’t offer a ton of support, and the unlined mesh cups simply sat against our boobs without giving them any lift. However, on a D cup or above, we felt this bra gave us plenty of support and a little perkiness, with a flattering amount of cleavage. We’d point smaller cup sizes to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pepper Classic All You Bra</a> instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>34B-40G<strong> | Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane <strong>| Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After doing some extensive research on the best bras for women, we gathered the 20 most highly rated comfortable bras on the market, and sent them to our esteemed team of editors. Each bra was tested by at least two people with varying body types in order to gauge how the bra performed on small and big chests. Over the course of three weeks, we gathered insights on how the bra felt, lifted, supported, and lasted. We took note of any pokings and discomfort. We then picked the 11 most comfortable bras that outperformed the rest, gathering our experiences here.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In this story, you will notice that every single one of the mentioned bras are made up of elastane (also referred to as spandex) and either nylon or polyamide. That’s because the most comfortable bras need to have a stretchy element to them that help them mold around the body. When combined with nylon, like in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aerie SMOOTHEZ Unlined Bra</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ThirdLove 24/7 Second Skin Unlined Bra</a>, the durable fabric allows you to wear the bra on a daily basis without it falling apart. Nylon, which was created as an alternative to silk, also adds a touch of smoothness to the bra that’s appreciated under form-fitting shirts. Polyamide, found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CUUP The Scoop Bra</a>, also comes with a softness and flexibility that when worn, can feel extraordinarily comfortable. Body-positive model Sophie Hughes says that the comfiest bras she owns are a mix of polyamide and polyester, because they also happen to wash well and retain their quality for some years.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wiring&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unless you go completely wireless with a bra like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">True & Co. Soft Form V Neck Adjustable Strap Bra</a> option, you’ll want to pay close attention to how the underwire fits you. As a common feature in bras, underwires provide additional support, particularly on bottom-heavy breasts, and lift the breast up. However, when sized incorrectly, they can dig into the skin and cause discomfort. To combat this, some brands have come up with creative engineering to provide underwires that don’t hurt. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aerie SMOOTHEZ Unlined Bra</a>, for example. The underwire is almost undetectable inside the buttery soft material of the band, and we never once had to fidget with it or feel it digging into our chest. For more traditional wiring, like in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SKIMS Fits Everybody T-shirt Bra</a>, the smooth polyamide and elastane band fabric camouflages the wiring adequately to make it feel near-invisible. We also recommend double checking your measurements against size guides to ensure you buy the correct size for you because this is also a surefire way to ensure the bra fits you properly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best bra to wear every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a comfortable bra you can wear every day, opt for something that “gives you the right level of support throughout the day,” says Cami Raymond, design director of shapewear brand Ruby Ribbon.

Bra fitting expert Sabrina Oxford explains that, more than material and style, the most comfortable bra will be the one that fits you properly. “It should feel like a nice hug on your body instead of a hammock for your breasts.” For bottom-heavy breasts, Oxford recommends bras with “more support, allowing you to relieve pressure on your shoulders since you aren’t relying on your straps to hold you up”. We found that options like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CUUP The Scoop Bra</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ThirdLove 24/7 Second Skin Unlined Bra</a>, where there was proper lining at the bottom of the bra, did just that for us.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On petite chests, the discomfort came from tight bands where the smallest cup sizes were still too big. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pepper Classic All You Bra</a> removed this worry altogether. Raymond chimes in that you want to look for “bras that have adjustable and convertible straps, so you can better customize the fit and avoid gaping.” All bras, with the exception of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SPANX Bra-llelujah! Lightly Lined Full Coverage Bra</a>, come with adjustable straps in this story.
