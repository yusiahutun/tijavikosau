If you count every song on the longest version of each (“Bonus,” “3 a.m.,” “Taylor’s Version,” et al.) and add in every B-side, collaboration, and stray Christmas-themed track, you end up with 204 in total. Of those, 43 are already on the main Eras set list each night, which takes us down to 161 options. We can then eliminate the songs she’s already chosen as surprises so far this tour, as well as&nbsp;“invisible string,” which she removed after breaking up with its muse, former boyfriend/block of unfrosted vanilla cake Joe Alwyn.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliymkr0z001q3b6xvq7f6oho@published data-word-count=70>That leaves Swift with 98 songs. Since they aren’t all equally likely to be played —&nbsp;surely she’ll use a spot on a widely beloved track like “Picture to Burn” and not, I don’t know, “Crazier” from the Hannah Montana soundtrack —&nbsp;we need an objective, data-driven metric that takes into account each remaining song’s commercial success, fan popularity, history on previous tour set lists, and suitability for a stripped-down acoustic cover.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cliymtqwy002w3b6xkqb6uo2h@published>An Objective Data-Driven Metric That Takes Into Account Each Remaining Song’s Commercial Success, Fan Popularity, History on Previous Tour Set Lists, and Suitability for a Stripped-Down Acoustic Cover:</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliymrw1e001v3b6xholip2dz@published data-word-count=99><strong>Billboard Hot 100 Chart data</strong>:&nbsp;The first listing on my model is a <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>chart score</span>, which factors in both peak position and total weeks on the Hot 100. One-hundred and ninety (!) Taylor Swift songs have spent at least one week on the Hot 100, and as of today, 69 of them remain in the running for the surprise set list.&nbsp;This is a good baseline for commercial success, although it typically focuses on success at the time of release.&nbsp;We also want to be able to measure a song’s performance five, ten, or 15 years later, so I also included …</p><p

data:</strong>&nbsp;The nice thing about both of these is that you can see cumulative and current data (streams from last week on Spotify, views from yesterday on YouTube).&nbsp;Cumulative data alone will overrate older songs, while current data will tell you that “Karma” is a bigger hit than “You Belong With Me”; when combined they should give us a fuller picture of a song’s <span

admitted that she loves it when people rank all her songs, and that she’d paid particularly close attention to the ascent of “All Too Well.”&nbsp;While I don’t weigh rankings very heavily compared with the other data above, I think it’s helpful for my metric to know that most fans and critics agree that “Ivy” is a better track than “Come in With the Rain.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph

2018’s reputation tour, Taylor cycled through 46 different acoustic songs on the “smaller” B-stage, either because they were her personal favorites, she knew fans loved them, or maybe because they were easy for her to play acoustically.&nbsp;In any case, her reasons for choosing them probably still apply <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>five years later</span>.&nbsp;Since then there have been six new Taylor Swift albums, so I am giving rep-tour B-stage songs a small bonus to their overall score.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader

data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliyms6oj002k3b6xr4pojrem@published data-word-count=174><strong>The Ed Factor: </strong>&nbsp;Swift has been a generous collaborator (or, if you want to be cynical about it, a ruthlessly savvy marketer) her whole career, working with country icons Tim McGraw and the Chicks; indie sad boys Bon Iver and the National; and rap stars Kendrick Lamar and Future.&nbsp;But for Swift, there’s one duet partner who is first among equals: Ed Sheeran.&nbsp;She helped anoint Ed as a pop star in 2013 when Swift invited him to collaborate on “Everything Has Changed,” a rather forgettable late entry on Red, and to open for that album’s tour.&nbsp;Since then, Ed has contributed vocals to reputation’s “End Game” and “Run.”&nbsp;Taylor loves to bring out collaborators in live shows to sing duets, so all collaborations are fair game on my list — except that Ed will be headlining his own show in Toronto this weekend, which makes his appearance at Swift’s Pittsburgh show (or any other show, as his tour extends through August) highly improbable.&nbsp;I actually do formally quantify this one: My metric penalizes the three Ed songs accordingly.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliymuepx00463b6x5ld23xeo@published data-word-count=214><strong>Local Color:</strong>&nbsp;Whenever possible, Taylor likes to play songs that reference the city she’s in, or feature beloved local artists.&nbsp;For example, in her three nights at Metlife Stadium in May, she played “Maroon,” (“And I chose you / the one I was dancing with / in New York”)&nbsp;“Holy Ground,” (“Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time”) “False God,” (“Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town / I’m New York City”), and of course, “Welcome to New York.” She also brought out her producer, co-writer, and “<a href=#>friend for life</a>” Jack Antonoff for “Getaway Car,” considered by many experts to be <a href=#>one of the most stirring depictions</a> of West Side Highway standstill traffic.&nbsp;Sadly, this is not super helpful because she does not mention Pittsburgh or most upcoming cities in any of her <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>songs</span>.&nbsp;As for collaborators, I couldn’t find anyone from Pittsburgh, but looking ahead, the National are all originally from the Cincinnati area (although she’s already played “coney island”), OneRepublic frontman and co-writer of “I Know Places” Ryan Tedder grew up an hour outside of Denver, and pretty much every pop star she’s ever worked with probably has a house in L.A.&nbsp;None of these affects today’s model, but feel free to make adjustments to your home city’s show as you see fit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliymuik0004c3b6x5j36nyzs@published data-word-count=137><strong>Numerology/Patterns:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, we all know Swift loves to plant <a href=#>Easter eggs</a> in her work for fans to frantically decipher.&nbsp;She’s also obsessed with numerology, has four songs with numeric titles (“the 1,” “seven,” “Fifteen,” and “22”), and considers 13 her lucky number.&nbsp;So there must be some code or pattern that she’s left us with the sequence of surprise songs so far, and … <strong></strong>look, I’ve spent more time staring at the colored dots on <a href=#>this USA Today graphic</a> than I care to admit.&nbsp;She’s only played songs from Lover on odd-numbered days.&nbsp;She plays the two songs in alphabetical order about two-thirds of the time.&nbsp;If you add 13 to the number of vowels in the first verse of each song she’s played … no, I’m sorry, I have nothing.&nbsp;Let me know in the comments if you’ve cracked any codes I’ve missed.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text

2006 self-titled debut album implausibly depicts teenaged Taylor as a pariah who is never invited to the cool sleepover birthday parties.&nbsp;It has earned the ignominious honor of being my model’s

it onto the extras section of a DVD set next to some bloopers and director’s commentary.&nbsp;And then the secret fourth movie was just as good as the first three if not better.&nbsp;Personally, I
