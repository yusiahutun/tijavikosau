Many of us are aware of this word and the use of bro code is common among male friendships. Friendship etiquette defines the Bro code, wherein individuals interact and behave with each other without any written rules governing their conduct. Trust and loyalty are the foundation of bro code.</p><p>Moreover, having a bro code also means having each other’s backs during tough times. They should take a stand for their friendship no matter what the situation is and fight for their honor. Another important thing to keep in mind is to never fight with each other for a woman. The dating aspect should never disrespect the bro’s code. Confidentiality should be there in the friendship so that bros can have a sense of trust in each other.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The psychology behind Morality</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The evolutionary origins of bro code</h4><p>The term bro code has gained popularity in recent years, but its origins stem from both evolutionary psychology and the historically significant roles men have played in society. If we look at the evolutionary past, then we can know more about how humans behave and interact with each other. Evolutionary psychology also talks about the theory that particular behaviors like the formation of close bonds are nothing but the result of natural selection and adaptation important for survival.</p><p>In relation to bro code, then hunters and gatherers have a significant role. Families in early times, primarily performed the jobs of hunting and gathering. It is quite obvious that these activities occur in groups, therefore, men need to interact with each other for survival. Hence, people will cooperate and this can be seen as the foundation for developing bro code.</p><p>The idea of bro code and masculinity share a close relationship. There is a prenotion about masculinity in many sections of our societies that characteristics like strength and self-sufficiency are the type of traits found in men. As a result, men may feel compelled to uphold these traits and follow the bro code’s expectations to maintain their sense of masculinity. Moreover, In early times, when hunting was an important job, and men had to rely on each other, therefore, any kind of disloyalty would bring bad results for them. Now, we have become aware of how loyalty is crucial for maintaining the bro code.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Bro Code as an Enforcement of Masculinity</h4><p>We have seen bro code as something harmless and healthy in friendship. But it also has a bad side as The bro code reinforces traditional masculinity norms and regulates male behavior that deviates from these norms.</p><p>Firstly, Traditional masculine norms, including stoicism and avoiding vulnerability, are reinforced by the Bro Code. However, in our society, if a man is crying then he is considered weak, similarly in bro code also showing emotions and <a href=#>vulnerability </a>is understood against the “manly” idea of men. An example of it could be the well-known slang of bro code i.e. bros before hoes. If a boy is expressive toward his romantic relationship, then his friends might think that he is weak or he is gives more priority to the girl. Moreover, if he is becoming vocal about his mental health issues then the bro code discourages it and rejects it by saying “Be a man”.</p><p>Secondly, By determining how men should behave in certain situations, the bro code reinforces traditional gender roles. For this the rule which says “never leave a man behind” describes men as a protector and always there for their friend. However, it promotes the idea of men being strong and self-sufficient and creates pressure to put their friendship above all things.</p><p>Thirdly, it also promotes the idea of physical violence. According to the bro, code men should never show back and be ready to fight or defend their dignity. This ideology not only glorifies the concept of aggression, but also makes the person harmful to himself and to the people around him. It is not the way to show <a href=#>masculinity</a>, instead it will create a negative image.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Criticism of the Bro Code</h4><p>Bro code is an essential thing in male friendships, but it comes with many things that can harm both men and women, one of them is setting rules. These rigid gender norms have disadvantages. This bro code sometimes promotes strict gender roles and expectations for the male community. This is harmful as it narrows down the meaning of masculinity and hence it affects the mental health of that person. These expectations often put pressure on the men to behave in a way like showing violence, aggression, and objectifying the women.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The Psychology of Money and Happiness</a></strong></p><p>Traits like these will not only create a bad character, but also make the individual not express their feelings properly. Another important aspect to highlight is how they glorify misogyny among themselves. Bro code often objectifies women and doesn’t understand their worth. Apart from the objectification of women, but also violence towards women is also there. Therefore, giving respect to women and challenging all the behaviors that can cause harm to women should not be encouraged.</p><p>Lastly, questioning loyalty is also a problematic aspect of bro code. While loyalty is something that can only be felt and shown when it’s needed, doubting someone’s loyalty can create problems. This trait holds a special value, but blind loyalty can make another person commits unethical behavior. It is common for bro to always support each other, even if it means overlooking harmful behaviors or attitudes. Normalizing such, toxic behavior can lead to harmful effects.</p><p>To avoid all such things people must understand the meaning of this relationship and the value it holds for them in their life. The word bro makes the bond between the male friends, but it is important to understand others aspects as well.</p>References+<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro_Code #Early_references<br>https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner<br>https://feminisminindia.com/2022/07/01/bro-code-locker-room-talk-male-friends-through-feminist-lens/<br>https://shapingyouth.org/the-bro-code-media-masculinity-misogynistic-misfires/</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Psychology of Stereotypes</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 16, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Incantations Vs.
