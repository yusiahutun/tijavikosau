for ABC’s KTRK TV in Houston, Texas, they refer to Elita Loresca.</p><p>The Filipino-American newscaster may not be one of the scientists who has studied meteorology in-depth, but she is certainly one of the best journalists who broadcast weather forecasts understandably and effectively that appeals to the target audience. You would not watch her show without understanding what she is talking about.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Prim Siripipat Bio, Married, Husband, Family, ESPN, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>On several occasions, Elita has been praised and admired for her journalistic commitment. Among other things, she received recognition for her coverage of two of the most devastating hurricane seasons in recent history, which ABC described as such. When Loresca began working for Fox television station WSVN in Miami, Florida, in 2004, she immediately began predicting and informing people about Hurricane France, which eventually became the second most powerful tropical storm of the year in the Atlantic. Frances was overly destructive, especially in Florida, and it is believed that the way Elita Loresca predicted the hurricane made people aware of the hurricane and eventually put their safety first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elita-Loresca-1.jpg><p>The following year, she again ensured people’s safety when Hurricane Katrina, Rita, and Wilma hit. It is said that she dutifully followed the National Hurricane Center’s tracking of the hurricanes to provide her station with useful and up-to-date information that would be valuable to the public.</p><p>KTRK-TV and WSVN are not the only media Loresca worked for. Before joining Fox Television in Miami, she worked as a morning and lunchtime weathercaster for CBS television station KGPE-TV in Fresno, California. Before that, from August 2002 to August 2004, she also held a similar position at KGET-TV, an NBC affiliate in Bakersfield, California, from January 2001 to August 2002.</p><p>Before joining the ABC-13 Eyewitness News Accuweather team at ABC-13 in Houston, Elita was also a member of NBC’s television program KBNC – “Today in LA”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Elita Loresca Biography</strong></h2><p>We traced the beginning of Loresca’s journalistic career when she worked as a news anchor for CBS-TV’s KCBS in Los Angeles. From what we learned, her responsibilities included putting together scripts and operating the teleprompter during news broadcasts.</p><p>Elita was born in the Philippines on June 28, 1977, and grew up in Southern California. Her family moved to the United States of America 9 months after her birth. When it was time for high school, she became a student at Chino High School. Here she developed a liking for playing basketball. She finally graduated from high school in 1995 and went to California State University, Fullerton. There, Elita completed a radio journalism program at the institution. She didn’t stop at that point when she transferred to Mississippi State University and earned a certificate in broadcast meteorology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elita-Loresca-Bio.jpg><p>Afterward, the American Meteorological Society presented the lady with a television seal of approval, and Elita is ready for a career in broadcast meteorology. She is currently a member of the American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association.</p><p>If asked to name one thing she cannot live without, Elita would talk about her father’s cooking and proclaim him the best cook. She loves food, her favorite holiday is Christmas, and her sisters call her Lee Lee Poo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband and Family, Is Elita Married?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elita-Loresca-Family.jpg><p>You will occasionally refer to Elita Loresca as Elita Nuveman. That’s because she’s married to Ryan Nuveman. Yeah, Ryan is the brother of Olympic softball medalist Stacey Nuveman.</p><p>The marriage between Elita and Ryan officially began on September 4, 2010, and has so far been with two children – a boy and a girl – so far. Elita and her family live with her lab assistant, Barrie Sanders, in Houston, Texas.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Larry The Cable Guy Wife, Sister, Family, Wiki, Real Name, Net Worth, House</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Elita Loresca’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Although it has been circulated that the net assets of Elita Loresca are $5 million, it would be malicious for us to notarize this. As far as we can tell, the figure has been guessed and in no way represents the true value of Elita Loresca’s assets.</p><p>There is no record of the journalist’s income available in the public domain, nor is any information known about her assets and investments. Given this, we would just like to point out that Elita is financially well off. The value of her wealth is best known to her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksq2105pkpaeimsCkrYyboKifopa9qcWMppirqpmasW601KyZmqaUYrOiucilsGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./man-arrested-trying-sex-tree-shocked-sunseekers-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Man arrested for 'trying to have sex with tree' after shocked sunseekers</a>
