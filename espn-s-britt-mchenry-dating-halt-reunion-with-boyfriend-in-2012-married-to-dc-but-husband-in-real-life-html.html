The personal life of Britt McHenry is somewhat unknown to us all. So, what is the real relationship status of the controversial&nbsp;reporter, Britt McHenry? And&nbsp;the real reason why many people hate her; this is what we are about to find out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Britt McHenry’s Personal Life: Married Life, Husband or Boyfriend?</h2><p>Formerly working as a sports reporter and fill-in anchor for ABC Television’s affiliate WJLA-TV, in Washington DC, she was offered a position of a sideline reporter at Fox Sports in San Diego. First, she took the job and moved to San Diego, considering her bright future there, but later she realized that it was a wrong move. Since she worked in Washington DC for several years, she was somewhat linked emotionally with the place. Due to which she returned to WJLA-TV in 2012, two weeks later joining Fox Sports.</p><p>There were some reasons for Britt to come back to Washington DC. While her love for Washington and her career path was one of the factors, she even stated in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> an interview with the Sports Junkies</a>, that her decision was solely based on professional desires and not a personal relationship. But we highly doubt that Britt!</p><p>While reevaluating the decision, she expressed that her heart was in Washington DC, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I just couldn’t fully get into it because I still had a foot here, My heart was here.”</p><p>Did it have a hidden meaning? The answer lies within Britt herself.</p><p>We know she is very hush-hush when it comes to her personal life. But there is a crucial information which Britt's ardent fans must know which is the "Skype Relationship." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same interview, she revealed that a “Skype relationship” is not her cup of tea (something smells fishy here). So, does this mean she is in a relationship with someone? Of course, you can’t be skyping to work and call it a “Skype relationship,” am I right? &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not very clear who McHenry was dating back then, but she sure was ecstatic to return to DC after two weeks. Now the question remains, is she still in a relationship with the same guy? Or is she married?</p><p>Britt's Instagram account gives a glimpse into her personal life, but still, no traces of her boyfriend is found. And she has maintained secrecy over a personal life. The mystery of her romantic life is killing her fans! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Like many celebrities, Britt has not been spared from the controversy, and following the controversy, people even demanded to fire her.</p><h2>The Verbal Abuse Controversy:</h2><p>Fame comes at a price, well this is what people say most of the times. And what price did our beloved, always smiling, gorgeous reporter, Britt McHenry had to pay? Let’s see. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Back on 2015, a video surfaced on the internet featuring Britt and a parking lot attendant. Britt was caught on camera, ranting and insulting the employee after her car got towed. Watch the full video below.</p><p>Later, she apologized for the incident via Twitter.</p><p><img alt height=198 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/brit-mchenry-tweet.jpg width=478 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was later announced by ESPN that McHenry was suspended for a week following the video controversy.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Even though the towing company forgave Britt for the misbehaving action</a>, there were thousands of people demanding her to be fired immediately. They even started a petition with the hashtag #FireBrittMcHenry on Twitter, calling her a bully and 3800 signatures were taken demanding her to be fired.</p><p>People can be mean sometimes, can’t they? And we hope Britt learned her lesson.</p><h2>Britt McHenry's&nbsp;Emotional Defense:</h2><p>Britt <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shares</a> the relation of pain with Philadelphia TV reporter Colleen Campbell as a video surfaced in the media on June 6, 2017. In the video, Colleen was doing a vicious trade and even tried to spit on the employee after she got kicked out from a comedy club in Philadelphia.</p><p>As she had a similar experience in the past, she expressed her thoughts through a Facebook post on June 7, 2017. Also, she shared the after effects of the public shaming and said that she had a serious long-term health effect, following the cyber bullying and shaming. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=798 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/britt-mchenry-twitter.jpg width=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Moreover, Britt stated a fact “No one is perfect, ” and everybody makes a mistake. And she ended the post hoping that least people have to go through the public shaming.</p><h2>Least Know Things About Britt:</h2><p>Britt McHenry was the native of Mount Holly Township, New Jersey. She played soccer during her high school and college years. We also came to know that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she is a major Chris Hemsworth fangirl</a> (just like most of us). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the information regarding her boyfriend or husband is not known, but we’re still on it so that we can provide enough info in the future.</p><p>Britt McHenry was born on May 28, 1986, in New Jersey. She is a graduate of Medill School of Journalism with a Master’s degree in Journalism. She currently serves as a sports reporter based in Washington DC for ESPN.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZp6roKN6tHnBq6CtrF2isKmxzauwZpyRqbavs4yhmKWsXaeytrrIqKVmr5mptW6uzrKdq6GVo7Futc1maWlpYmK6or7RopydZaSkeqWvjJusrWWYqsCjrc2dZKKmXaeyoriMpaCfnV6dwa64</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gigi-hadid-moles-bikini-picture.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gigi Hadid Shows Off Her Moles in a Bikini Photo</a>
