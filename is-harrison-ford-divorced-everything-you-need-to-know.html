But fans are currently unsure of his marital status. So, is Harrison Ford divorced or married?</strong></p><p>Known for his leading roles in films of various genres, Harrison Ford has been a household name for decades. He has been linked to several women and married a few times, but this hasn’t stopped fans from asking about his marital status. Here’s a look at the iconic figure’s story of love, heartbreak, and growth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Harrison_Ford></span>Who Is Harrison Ford?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harrison Ford is a well-known American actor and pilot. He was born July 13, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were former radio actress Dorothy and advertising executive and former actor John William “Christopher” Ford.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harrison.jpg><p>He schooled in Illinois and graduated in 1960 from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois. His voice was the inaugural student voice broadcast on his high school’s new radio station, “WMTH,” and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year.</p><p>After graduating high school, Ford attended Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, where he was a philosophy major. During the last quarter of his senior year, he enrolled in a drama class intending to overcome his shyness, and it was here that his fascination with acting ignited. Sadly, the actor never got to complete college as he was expelled from college four days before graduation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Harrison_Fords_Rise_to_Fame></span>Harrison Ford’s Rise to Fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ford moved to California to pursue his radio career but was unsuccessful. He began taking minor roles as an extra to kickstart his career. After a couple of years of being offered non-speaking and different roles, <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a> decided to take up professional carpentry to support his nuclear family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/harrison-70s.jpg><p>Some of his clients were famous Hollywood writers. One helped him secure an audition with “Star Wars” filmmaker George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford played in “American Graffiti” in 1973.&nbsp;</p><p>It was up from there for Ford, and he went on to bag a role in “Star Wars” as Han Solo with A-lister James Earl Jones. This role gained him worldwide recognition and opened the door to many of his leading roles in Hollywood’s biggest films.&nbsp;</p><p>Ford is now regarded as an American cultural icon due to his successful career. His films have grossed over $5.4 billion in North America and more than $9.3 billion worldwide, making him the seventh-highest-grossing actor in North America!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Harrison_Ford_Divorced></span>Is Harrison Ford Divorced?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The actor is currently not divorced and does not seem to be getting divorced anytime soon. He is still happily married to his wife of over ten years. Although the “Indiana Jones” star has been in very public relationships and divorces over the years, the third time seems to be the charm in his love life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calista-and-harrison.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Harrison_Ford_Wives_Meet_the_Women_He_Married></span>Harrison Ford Wives: Meet the Women He Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “American Graffiti” star has been in three marriages, two ending in public and dramatic divorces.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Calista_Flockhart_2010_%E2%80%93_Present></span>Calista Flockhart (2010 – Present)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>American actress <a href=#>Calista Kay Flockhart</a> is the current wife of Harrison Ford.

This role earned her a Golden Globe Award in 1998 and a three-time nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calista.jpg><p>The “Web Therapy” actress reportedly met Ford at the Golden Globes Awards on January 20, 2002. They began dating but kept it private as Ford was in a rough divorce with Melissa Mathison.&nbsp;</p><p>After his divorce was finalized, they made their relationship public and engaged on Valentine’s Day in 2009. They married in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2010 and have remained together ever since.</p><p>Flockhart had previously adopted a son, Liam, before their union, whom Ford embraced and legally adopted, becoming the boy’s official parent. After being inactive for some years, Flockhart returned to the acting scene and can be seen in projects like “Supergirl” and “Full Circle.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Mathison_1983-2004></span>Melissa Mathison (1983-2004)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hollywood star film and television screenwriter Melissa Mathison was born in Los Angeles on June 3, 1950. She found fame after writing the screenplays for 1979’s “The Black Stallion” and 1982’s “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” The latter earned her a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards and more popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>Mathison and Ford reportedly met on the “Apocalypse Now” set during one of her visits. They began dating and married officially in 1983. Their union produced two children, Malcolm and Georgia. In 2000, they tried a trial separation before formally filing for divorce later that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Their very public divorce was finalized in 2004, with Mathison getting about $85 million in settlement fees as they didn’t have a prenup signed.&nbsp;In 2015, Mathison died at 65 after a long battle with cancer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mary_Marquardt_1964-1979></span>Mary Marquardt (1964-1979)&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ford and <a href=#>Mary Marquardt</a>, born in 1945, wed on June 18, 1964, after a meeting at Ripon College, which they both attended. While Ford took on his Hollywood career, Marquardt graduated with a degree in Culinary Arts and had a career in the food industry. They had two children, Benjamin and Willard, during their marriage. They divorced in 1979 but remained co-parents to their children over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Harrison Ford looks like he got it right with his third marriage and has been visibly happy ever since.
