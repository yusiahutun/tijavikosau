With dazzling diamonds, and ornate shapes of various metals people of all cultures have enjoyed flaunting their jewels. Shifting its focus from being a representation of a culture, jewels today are widely used to gift, and make bold and beautiful statements.</p><p>Featuring for The Enterprise World’s this issue of The Most Inspiring Business Leaders to Watch in 2022 is Dr. Tauqeer Imran, a connoisseur of fine jewelry, who with his excellent skills is creating dreams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dr. Tauqeer Imran- Leading the Way-</h2><p>Dr. Tauqeer Imran, the visionary leading Ron Jewelry to the heights of success is not just a successful and wealthy businessman but is also a Pakistan-trained surgeon. Being a cancer survivor himself with a professional medical background, Tauqeer is also fond of inspiring other cancer patients with the help of his support groups and hospitals. He is also a prime supporter of the American Cancer Society and other charitable institutions, adding to his philanthropic efforts.</p><p>Tauqeer took interest in jewelry making during his childhood when he assisted his uncle in running his jewelry stores. With steady efforts, Tauqeer rose to the ranks to become the regional manager of many stores across the country before he branched out to create his own company.</p><p>Tauqeer today runs jewelry stores like Ron Jewelry and Mr. Goldman and Sons in Louisiana and Texas. The stores specialize in custom engagement rings and special orders, as well as Simon G., Gabriel & Co., and Scott K. brands.</p><p>“Our aim is to make people happy, and we make that happen with excellent customer service.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Shining on Like Diamonds!</h3><p>Tauqeer was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017 and endured 12 rounds of chemotherapy, six rounds of radiation, and many operations. “Doctors gave me 15 days to a month to live,” he recalls, “yet I came back to life.” “It was a miracle, and I want others to know that it is possible.” With his medical training, he can better convey what it’s like to go through chemo and radiation to other cancer patients.</p><p>“I work with a support group and inspire them; they need the strength and determination to get back on their feet.”</p><p>His interests, on the other hand, are as diverse as his attitude toward life. He was trained as a surgeon in Pakistan and has returned on a regular basis to help those in need. He has attended intense online archaeology courses as a result of his interest in Pakistan’s ancient history and civilization.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ron Jewelry- A Legacy of Love</h3><p>In 1988, the corporation was established&nbsp;and quickly evolved into one of the most recognized and trusted family jewelers in the region.</p><p>Since then, the business has continued to thrive.

For security and durability, it is best to restring pearl necklaces and bead jewelry at least every five years.</p><p>Cultured pearls are often strung on silk thread with a knot between each pearl. This keeps the pearls from rubbing against each other and prevents all the pearls from cascading to the floor if the necklace was to break.</p><p>Silk thread is susceptible to wear and tear, especially if you wear the necklaces all the time. The fine silk can stretch and weaken, so if you see extra space between the knots that separate the pearls from each other, that could be a sign that the necklace needs to be restrung.</p><p>“Trust our experts to handle&nbsp;your finest pearl and gemstone beads.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Watch Repairs</h3><p>Whether your watch needs a new battery or a complete mechanical overhaul, trust Ron Jewelers to get the job done right.</p><p>Watch repair takes special care and talent and their expert watchmakers have been helping customers for years.
