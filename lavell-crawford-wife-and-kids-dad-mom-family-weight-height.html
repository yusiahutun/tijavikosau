Lavell Crawford is an American stand-up comedian and actor.</p><p>He began performing stand-up comedy in the 1990s when he was in his early twenties. He performed in various clubs and later achieved a spot on the 1990s BET show Comic View. Crawford gained widespread recognition in 2007 as one of the candidates for NBC’s competitive reality show Last Comic Standing. He finished second and lost first place to Jon Reep.</p><p>Since then his career has taken a huge leap forward. Like most comedians, Crawford tried his hand at acting and appeared on a handful of television shows. The most remarkable of these is the role of Huell Babineaux in Breaking Bad, which he portrayed from 2011 to 2013. He had to play his role in the 2017 spin-off Better Call Saul again. Crawford has also appeared on other television shows such as New Girl and Legends of Chamberlain Heights, where he was the narrator in Aqua Teenager Hunger Force.</p><p>Lavell Crawford continues to appear on stand-up shows around the country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lavell Crawford Dad, Mom</strong></h2><p>Crawford is one of those stars who had a difficult childhood. He struggled with his weight as a child, and when he was 10 years old, he nearly drowned. His hardship was intensified by the fact that his father Daryl Crawford left the family and his mother Annita Crawford who raised him and his two sisters Elonda and Erica.</p><p>Crawford was estranged from his father for over twenty years of his life. It was reported that they reconciled in 2010. In an interview with VLAD TV in 2017, Crawford revealed that his father, who worked as a bodybuilder, was gay – a discovery they made only after his return when he reunited with his family.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kyla Ross Height, Age, Parents, Quick Facts About The Artistic Gymnast</a></strong></p><p>Daryl Crawford told his family that he had left them because he found out he was gay and didn’t know how to explain it to them, so he ran away from home. Crawford told VLAD that his wife suspected a change in sexuality as the only reason his father would leave them when they were kids. Crawford’s father later married a white man who died in 2015.</p><p>Crawford’s reaction when he learned of his father’s sexuality was strange; there was a thought that his father’s gayness might be genetic, so he feared that perhaps a gay switch in his system might turn on and he too might become gay.</p><p>In explaining his views on gays, Crawford said that no matter how much gays were accepted, the fact remained that homosexuality was still “damned odd”. He expressed that in his jokes he was talking about gay stuff, but that he was also afraid of the gay mafia, so he addressed them in a way he should.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family:&nbsp;Wife and Kids</strong></h2><p>Lavell Crawford is married and has three children. His wife is DeShawn Crawford. It is not known when Crawford and his wife tied the knot, but it is likely that it could have been in the 90s when two of their children are in their twenties.</p><p>Crawford is not really open about his private life and so for a long time, it was stated in many publications (even serious ones) that he has only one child. This entry was officially invalidated in 2017 when Crawford told the media that he has three children, including two boys and a daughter. One of his sons and one of his daughters are in their twenties, while the other son was born around 2011.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tara Setmayer Husband, Parents, Bio, Wiki, Age, Ethnicity</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Weight, Height</strong></h2><p>Crawford’s most remarkable trademark over the years was his weight. However, sometime in 2015, he began his journey to lose weight. During his visit to the Sway In the Morning show in 2016, Crawford revealed that he decided to lose weight in order to be able to be there for his wife and children longer and not to leave his wife hanging.</p><p>After a period of weight loss through diet and exercise, Crawford underwent surgery on the stomach cuff in March 2016. According to the Black Doctor, the operation will take place in two phases, one year apart. Crawford performed the first phase, which involves reducing the size of the stomach.</p><p>Lavell Crawford weighed up to 475 pounds in his overweight years. Now he has lost 120 pounds and has dropped to about 350 pounds.</p><p>Crawford is 5’10” tall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuaLCxKWjZpuilsSnu9GdZLChlpp6orrDZqKinKNisaKwjKampmWWlrqquNhmrp6hl53BbrTEop6hrF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meaning-of-thats-what-friends-are-for-by-elton-john.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meaning of Thats What Friends Are For by Elton John</a>
