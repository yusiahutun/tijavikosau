Instead of treating them as separate systems, you control them all from one place, and music plays through all of them simultaneously.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Use Apple's New Multi-Room Audio Features in AirPlay 2</a></span></p><p>There are two main ways of setting up a whole home audio system. The older, more traditional route uses loudspeakers and speaker wire, usually running through your walls. These systems have traditionally never been wildly popular outside of enthusiast circles.</p><p>However, interest in multi-room and whole home audio has picked up in recent years thanks to companies like Sonos offering wireless speakers that easily link with one another. Smart speakers from Google, Apple, Amazon, and others also often feature multi-room playback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wired-whole-home-audio-the-pros-and-cons>Wired Whole Home Audio: The Pros and Cons</h2><p>One of the most popular reasons that people opt for wired whole home audio systems is the ability to customize. You can carefully choose each component, place them exactly where you want, and craft every element in the system exactly how you want it. This is why this method still appeals to audio enthusiasts.</p><p>These are typically standard audio and home theater components, meaning you can mix and match as much as you feel like. If you want to use one brand of speakers and another brand for your amplifier, nothing is going to stop you.</p><p>Using standard, off-the-shelf stereo components also helps keep things cheap. Speakers and speaker wires are much cheaper than buying wireless speakers with integrated amplifiers and other components built-in. This is relative, and you can still spend a lot of money, but you can certainly save money if you try.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/choose-right-speaker-wires-banana.jpg><p>While you may end up saving money with a wired whole home audio system, there is a trade-off: time. All that customizability means you'll need to make sure that all your components work well together, like <a href=#>matching impedances between your amplifier and speakers</a>.</p><p>You may think that the wiring aspect hard isn't, especially if you've <a href=#>wired your home theater system</a> before. That knowledge does translate, but there is more to consider, like running wires through walls. If you're a new homeowner or in the middle of remodeling, this may be easy, but otherwise wiring will be the toughest part of the setup.</p><p>It's not always just a single amp, <a href=#>speakers</a>, and <a href=#>wires</a> either. Depending on the size of your setup and how many rooms you're wiring, you may need additional amplifiers and other equipment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wireless-whole-home-audio-the-pros-and-cons>Wireless Whole Home Audio: The Pros and Cons</h2><p>The wireless variety of whole home audio is likely the one most people think of these days when they hear the term. Modern wireless multi-room speaker systems made whole home audio easy to set up. Just plug in your speakers, connect them to Wi-Fi, and start listening.</p><p>Wireless whole home audio systems are also typically easier to use. Rather than a physical remote control for a wired system, most wireless multi-room systems let you control every aspect of them with either your voice or your phone. This makes adjusting volumes or only playing in certain rooms much easier.</p><p>Beyond controlling playback and volume, wireless whole home systems are generally much smarter than wired systems. You can <a href=#>create a basic multi-room system with Amazon Echo speakers</a>, for example. Even if you're not using a smart speaker, they often still let you trigger and interact with your phone's voice assistant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sonos-one-1.jpg><p>No wires means no installation. Running speaker wire is the hardest part of setting up a wired whole home audio system, and the only cables you have to worry about with a wireless system are the power cables you plug into the wall.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi Music: Which Has Better Audio Quality?</a></span></p><p>One final pro with wireless systems is that you can potentially get a best of both worlds scenario. You'll find product lines like Yamaha MultiCast, which have the convenience of wireless whole home audio with more traditional <a href=#>home theater systems</a> and other speaker options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, this ease of use doesn't come cheap. Wireless whole home audio systems can get expensive fast, and the price only goes up with each additional room. Setting up a simple two-room with <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sonos One</a> speakers will run you nearly $600, for example.</p><p>The other big downside with wireless whole home audio systems is that many brands don't work with other brands. For example, you're not going to have an easy time getting speakers from Apple and Google to work well together.</p><h2 id=which-is-the-right-option-for-you>Which Is the Right Option for You?</h2><p>If you're looking for the easiest option, then wireless wins by a mile. A wireless multi-room system is easy to set up, easy to use, and you can start with two or three speakers and add more as you want. Just make sure to remember that the price can start rising pretty quickly.</p><p>On the other hand, if you opt to have someone install a wired whole home audio system for you, you're going to be spending a lot as well. The wired option is best if you absolutely must have the custom layout of your dreams. This is also perfect for you if the journey is the destination, and you think you'll enjoy the build process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter which way you choose, you'll likely be thrilled with the results.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What You Need to Know About Speaker Wiring Cables</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvaW9hZn1ww8eoo55lmKS6pnnArpuip12strOxw2amq2Wnnr%2BmuMSsqmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zendaya-tiny-diamond-bra-puffed-gown-27th-birthday.html>&#171;&nbsp;Zendaya Is a Birthday Vision in a Tiny Diamond Bra and Patterned Gown</a>
