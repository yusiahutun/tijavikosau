The answer is no. Jared “JP” Pierce and Taylor Rue met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 5. JP and Taylor were one of three couples who got engaged on Love Is Blind Season 5, along with Izzy and Stacy; and Lydia and Milton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, JP and Taylor did not get married, according to public records from the Harris County Clerk’s Office in Texas, where Houston is located and Love Is Blind Season 5 was filmed. There is no record of JP and Taylor obtaining their marriage license, which means they likely were not one of the couples that got married in the Love Is Blind Season 5 finale.</p><p>JP and Taylor broke up in Episode 6 after JP called Taylor “fake” for wearing makeup, and Taylor told JP that he wasn’t the same person she knew in The Pods. At the time of Love Is Blind Season 5’s premiere, JP and Taylor were still following each other on Instagram.&nbsp;JP and Taylor confirmed they were not back together in the Love Is Blind Season 5 reunion.</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>E! News</a> in September 2023, Taylor explained why she she decided to break up with JP. “It was really hard,” Taylor said. “I mean just the reveal was a little bit awkward, but in my mind, I was like, ‘He’s probably nervous, I’m nervous,’ and in a way, we were having to start over because we just had the emotional connection.”</p><p>Taylor told E! News that, when their connection “didn’t get any better” on their vacation, she brought it up to JP to “hopefully fix it.” “But it only got worse because I brought it up. My hope was to fix it and our relationship. It was heartbreaking,” she said.</p><p>Taylor also told E! News’ reaction to JP criticizing how much makeup she wears. “When he initially said it, I was like, ‘What in the world?'” Taylor said. “Like, there is no way you are acting completely different because of the way I look. We are on here for an emotional connection and we had built such a strong connection between us.” She continued, “I don’t think there’s a lot of truth behind that, but I was definitely hurt about it.”</p><p>Taylor confirmed that she the makeup comment wasn’t the reason she broke up with JP. “I didn’t leave J.P. due to the makeup comment, I left JP because I fell in love with this version of him and then that version was no longer there,” she said. “The person I fell in love with was not there and that was scary.”</p><p>She continued, “I had one foot in the door, one foot out, and nobody deserves that. Everybody deserves someone who is 100 percent about them and I also know he was not 100 percent about me. You just don’t completely change the way you act based on the way somebody looks.”</p><p>Taylor also confirmed that she and JP have spoken since their split. “I just wasn’t ready. I was like, ‘I don’t want to talk to you, I don’t want to see you,'” she said. “And then a couple of months back, I actually reached to him and we had good conversation, but we actually didn’t talk about anything that really needs to be talked about, so still waiting for that.” She continued, “It took me some time to get back to myself. I needed to heal from what I went through with JP. But after I got past all that, I feel stronger and I love myself more. I learned to date with more intent and so I learned a lot of things.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in September 2023, Taylor also explained her reaction to JP’s criticism over her makeup. “I was confused because I don’t know how you could just shut yourself off because of the way somebody looks when you had built such a great emotional connection beforehand,” Taylor said. “I also don’t think he was being completely transparent about everything. I think there’s a deeper issue there — still don’t know what it is. I plan to figure it out. But it was hurtful. He put the blame on somebody for the way they look. I took so long to get ready that day to look good for him, and then he basically told me I didn’t look good.”</p><p>She continued, “It was probably day two or three where I was like, ‘I just cannot do this.’ I knew that I had to move home with him, and for me, I’ve never lived with a guy before. That’s a big deal, a big step in a relationship. I did not think him and I were ready for that. The situation wasn’t getting any better. I thought it would after our conversation, but honestly it just got worse. I wasn’t a 100 percent in it and I don’t think he was either.”</p><p>Taylor also told Entertainment Weekly what her final straw was in her breakup with JP. “I don’t think moving home with him would’ve fixed anything,” she said. “Probably would’ve driven us to really bad terms. So I think I made the right decision. And for me, those type of things that were going to come after the living together, the bachelorette party, the marriage, all of that, I want to do it one time with the right person. Although I loved him and cared about him, it didn’t feel 100 percent right, so I have no regrets.”</p><p>Taylor is a 26-year-old teacher from the Houston, Texas, area.

In the pods, Taylor is laser-focused on meeting her future husband, who she says must be honest to a fault — oh, and at least slightly taller than her. Lying is her ultimate deal-breaker, as past exes haven’t exactly been faithful. And, should she leave the experiment with a ring, she can’t wait to deck the halls with her partner, because Christmas is her absolute favorite time of year.”</p><p>JP is a 32-year-old firefighter from the Houston, Texas, area.

In the past, Jared didn’t ‘get in-depth with relationships,’ and they’ve always lacked a genuine connection. The dating scene in Houston is a bit too superficial for his taste, as he says apps and meeting women out at bars aren’t geared toward long-term commitment. Jared knows that if he can find a woman in the pods who’ll be patient, he’ll be able to let down his walls and show his ‘big heart,’ which he counts as one of his best traits.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwedKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZZykw6Z5yKxkm6SZo7Fuv8SaqqimXWp8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./venn-diagram-types-visualize-data.html>&#171;&nbsp;10 Types of Venn Diagrams That Help You Visualize Relationships</a>
