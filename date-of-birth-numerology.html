All you need to know is a person’s birthday, because the birthday number is simply the day of the month in which they were born. If you were born on the 8th, your birthday number is 8. If you were born on the 29th, your number is 29. Also, FYI—this is one of the few cases in numerology where double-digit numbers are not reduced to a single digit number. This means your birthday number could be any number 1-31.
