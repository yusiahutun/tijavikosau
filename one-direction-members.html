They created fan frenzies reminiscent of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Beatles</a>. The group that reminded female fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“You Don’t Know You’re Beautiful”</a> put out five albums in 6 years while crisscrossing the globe on world tours. Their first four albums debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, making history and cementing the band’s musical legacy.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/8_92e930.jpg><p>Then One Direction announced they were officially going on hiatus in 2016. And while fans held their breath, the bandmates each went out on their own. They launched solo careers, took on acting roles, became entrepreneurs and started families.</p><p>It was a time we didn’t think Harry Styles could get any more famous. Now those five talented teens are all in their 30s. (Sing with me: “Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?” ) If you’re curious where your favorite 1D boys are now, you’ve come to the right place.

But he left us with lots of memorable moments. Like hitting that high note in the solo for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“You & I,”</a> getting a plate of spaghetti dumped on his head in the music video for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Night Changes,”</a> or bleaching a strip of his dark hair blonde.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/9_883537.jpg><p>So what has ZAYN been up to since leaving the band? He was the first solo member of One Direction to reach 1 billion streams on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, all without touring. That popularity was driven by solo hits like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Pillow Talk.”</a> And the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,”</a> a collab with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> for the film 50 Shades Darker in 2017. (That duet also nabbed him an MTV Video Music Award.) Zayn is considered the only artist to have nabbed the Billboard Music Award in the category of New Artist of the Year twice!</p><p>Away from music, Zayn became a father in 2020 to baby girl Khai with former partner, model <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gigi Hadid</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Liam Payne, 30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_ee5aba.jpg><p>When the group started, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Payne</a> stepped out as an unofficial leader. Since he’d been on the “X Factor” the year before, he was considered an early front runner in the competition. Liam sang the first verse on many of One Direction’s early songs since he didn’t suffer from stage fright.</p><p>Fans cheered whenever this band member sang about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“five-foot somethin’ with the skinny jeans.”</a> Or confidently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flipped his red microphone</a> in the air, one of his trademark dance moves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/10_25cc77.jpg><p>Since the band went on hiatus, this 1D alum has experimented with different genres of music including R&B. His song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Strip That Down”</a> is his biggest solo hit to date. Liam also became a father to son Bear in 2017. And he appeared as a guest judge on an episode of “The X Factor UK” in 2018. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Niall Horan, 30, One Direction Members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/3_adc216.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niall Horan</a> is one-of-a-kind. This singer and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guitarist</a> is the only member of One Direction who consistently played an instrument in the band. This Irishman is also the only non-English member of the group. And the only bandmate who doesn’t have any tattoos (as far as we know.)</p><p>Niall’s fun-loving personality is one reason many fans—called Directioners—adored the band. We can still hear him rocking, “You and me and all our friends. I don’t care how much we spend. This is what the night is foooorrrrrr.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/11_588f93.jpg><p>Since the band members went their separate ways, Niall has launched a successful solo career. He has three #1 solo albums. His hits including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Slow Hands”</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Nice to Meet Ya.” </a>He also joined the cast of the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“The Voice” </a>as a coach, winning his first and second season. But Niall isn’t all music. He has become a savvy businessman, having his hands in several ventures including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modest! Golf</a>, a sports management company. This Irishman loves golf!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Tomlinson, 32</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/4_57c61c.jpg><p>The One Direction member with the most song-writing credits, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis Tomlinson</a> is considered the group’s master lyricist. (He wrote fan favorite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“No Control,”</a> among others.) His antics and on-stage pranks, whether spraying water or making funny faces, always kept fans engaged. Louis is also the oldest member of One Direction.</p><p>In fact, when the band formed, he was the only member with a driver’s license. So you can catch him in many of 1D’s music videos driving vehicles. (Some with more success than others.) Plus, he put the blue-collar town of Doncaster on the map. Louis is rumored to have been the member of the band most resistant to taking a hiatus. But as the tattoo across his chest says, “It Is What It Is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/12_de221c.jpg><p>Since the band’s break, Louis has been faced with personal tragedy. He lost his mom to leukemia, as well as the unexpected death of his sister. Despite all that, Louis put out two solo albums, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Walls”</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Faith in The Future,”</a> one which hit #1 in the UK.</p><p>He also launched a world tour, which was massively successful, especially in South America, where Louis is beloved. During the pandemic, Louis also broke the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guinness World Record</a> for the most livestreamed concert by a male solo artist. As the oldest in a big family, Louis also has a knack for mentoring.</p><p>He participated as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">judge</a> for the 2018 season of “The X Factor UK,” which he won. And he dabbles in talent management. At home, he is father to son Freddie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Harry Styles, 30, One Direction Members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/5_72ee8d.jpg><p>Last but not least… <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> was a fan favorite back during the days of One Direction,&nbsp; adored for his brown curls and green eyes. And his memorable fashion sense. (Can you picture the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">red floral Gucci suit</a>?!)</p><p>But since then, Harry’s star has risen even farther. He’s put out three solo albums and launched two world tours. His last two albums <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fine Line”</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Harry’s House”</a> won a combined three Grammy Awards. That’s an elusive prize that he never won even with his success with One Direction.</p><p>These days, his solo songs like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Watermelon Sugar”</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“As It Was”</a> are on repeat on the radio. And let’s not forget that Taylor Swift’s wildly successful <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour</a> devotes time to her album 1989. That’s the album rumored to be written about Harry. (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“We never go out of Style.”</a>)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/13_5b8c0b.jpg><p>In addition to singing, Harry also caught the acting bug. His debut role was starring in Academy-Award-nominated film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dunkirk</a>. He’s also been in two independent films and is hinted to star in the upcoming The Eternals sequel.</p><p>Since Harry’s days with 1D, he has continued to show off his unique fashion sense. He often wears sequins and feather boas on stage. He was even a cohost for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Met Gala </a>in 2019. Plus, Harry launched a line of nail polish, called Pleasing. And he preaches love and respect to fans with his TPWK (Treat People With Kindness) anti-bullying platform.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What could be next for the members of One Direction?</h2><p>So, that’s what the bandmates have been up to in recent years. One thing is for sure, as the band said in their last song together, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“you and me gotta whole lot of history.”</a>&nbsp;</p><p>But what’s next? Devoted fans still continue to hope for a reunion in the future. (Maybe 2050 in the Las Vegas Sphere?) But until then, we’ll leave you with a lyric from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Walking in the Wind”</a>… “But it’s&nbsp;not the end, I’ll see your face again.”</p><p><strong>For more of your favorite bands, keep reading!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Best U2 Songs: 13 of Their Greatest Anthems, Ranked</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">See the Duran Duran Band Members Then and Now</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mamas and the Papas and the Drama that Unfolded for the Muscians</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Bku6Z5w6KpnpuknryvecyepJudoqg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pomegranate-grapefruit-paloma.html>&#171;&nbsp;pomegranate grapefruit paloma</a>
