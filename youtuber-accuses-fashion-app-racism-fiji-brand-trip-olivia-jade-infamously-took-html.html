Kianna, who has 740,000 subscribers on YouTube, was one of the women on the trip — including stars like Olivia Jade and Emma Chamberlain.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Kianna felt 'grateful' to be invited on the brand trip, she also felt like the 'token black girl' for the company to promote diversity in future brand pictures.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I’m so glad I got to experience it, but I wish it hadn’t been with this company,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The YouTuber went on to say she was not upset specifically about anyone who was on the trip. Instead, she was frustrated with how she felt she was treated by the brand regarding her race.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I didn’t speak up because I was protecting a company that didn’t care about my well-being in the slightest,' she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I thought that I could be representation for black girls all over the world. But for me to feel like the token black girl on two trips in a row; it’s dead. I don’t want to do it anymore.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of the biggest issues mentioned by Kianna in her 16-minute video was the lack of incentive the brand had to feature her in pictures or get her photographed while in Fiji.&nbsp;Since the trip was largely focused on taking pictures, Kianna said she felt like an 'outcast' because the photographers had allegedly no interest in shooting with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'No one is taking pictures of you on a trip that is about pictures, you’re going to feel very uncomfortable,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When speaking to DailyMail.com, a Dote spokesperson later clarified that only two photo shoots were scheduled during the trip. Outside those photo shoots, it was up to the photographers and attendees to schedule individual sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/14/23/13502282-0-image-a-73_1557872214876.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Male model reveals disgraced online star James Charles...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/14/15/13487814-0-image-a-42_1557845289141.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>James Charles' career continues to go up in flames: Enraged...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <img id=i-753021e39cc3c5e3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/15/20/13540230-7032805-image-m-31_1557946940418.jpg height=612 width=634 alt="Not happy: 'For me to feel like the token black girl on two trips in a row; it¿s dead,' she said, claiming the brand lacked diversity.

It appeared some of the influencers, such as Olivia Jade (second from the left), received more face time with photographers than other people on the trip&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kianna said she addressed concerns about photo shoots with the event organizers, who then organized a separate photo shoot on the beach with a group of women. But Kianna said they pictures were never used by the brand and instead just 'discarded' by the photographer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I know what you’re thinking, honestly. “It’s not that big of a deal, it doesn’t matter,"' she continued in the video.&nbsp;'But I want to let you guys know it’s not about getting pictures in Fiji. It’s about feeling unwelcome, it’s about feeling uncomfortable, it’s about feeling like an outcast.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Promoting diversity in the social media industry is a priority Kianna hopes many brands will focus on in the coming years. But she felt there lacked an understanding of how to address diversity needs from Dote.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Diversity is not throwing one black girl among a whole bunch of white ones and being like, "Aye we’re diverse,"' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don’t think this company knows how to handle women of color, and I don’t think they want to.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Statements by Kianna against the company come as multiple women have called out the brand for lacking diversity. These claims were ignited after Coachella when the brand was accused of separating nonwhite girls with white girls in the home they rented for the California festival.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>DailyMail.com contacted Dote about the controversy with the Fiji trip and the claims it was exclusive to specific attendees.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-17486e385cc8c8b4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/15/20/13540234-7032805-image-a-35_1557948898168.jpg height=593 width=634 alt="Revealed: In a statement, Dote said: 'We have always gone to great lengths to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect.'

'We take constructive comments very seriously, and we continually strive to build a community that promotes and celebrates diversity and equality.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kianna said she met with someone from the Dote team when leaving Fiji to discuss ways the company could change how it handled brand trips to better accommodate all attendees.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A Dote spokesperson said the company took her suggestions seriously and later altered how photo shoots were scheduled to make sure no influencer felt they lacked time with a photographer. The company also employed a change to its photographer policies.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lori Loughlin's daughter Olivia Jade, 19, was another influencer on the brand trip. The YouTuber shared a number of snaps of herself on the beach during the tropical vacation, which was also during her first week of classes at the University of Southern California.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time, no one knew Olivia and her family would later become embroiled in controversy regarding how the young YouTuber got into college. In March, it was revealed that Lori and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, paid $500,000 to get both of their children into USC.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The two daughters have since left the Los Angeles university while their parents face criminal charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboOPbGlxaGVkprDBs66ZnqpdlrCkwdKeqmaekai1qrvNZpipqF2nrqS10qZkf6GannqjvsCnm2asop69bpvLoq2imV1%2FrqWxjKKln5mdpMK0uNhmq6inm2O1tbnL</p></div><div id=links><a href=./438810-15-movies-tv-shows-yellowstone-watch-2022.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 best movies and TV shows like Yellowstone to watch in 2022</a>
