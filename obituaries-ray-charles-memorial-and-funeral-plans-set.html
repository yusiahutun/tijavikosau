(AP) — Howard Solomon, a former New York City nightclub owner who fought obscenity charges after foul-mouthed comedian Lenny Bruce performed at his club, died June 3 of a heart attack. He was 75.</p><p>He died at his home in Crestline, his son Jason Solomon said.</p><p>Bruce was arrested shortly before he was to perform at Howard Solomon's Cafe au Go Go club in Greenwich Village on April 3, 1964. Vice officers had recorded Bruce performing at the club earlier in the week.</p><p>Solomon and his wife, Elly Solomon, were also arrested; he was charged with allowing an obscene act to perform in his club.</p><p>Solomon pleaded innocent, but a three-judge Criminal Court panel passed down a guilty verdict against both him and Bruce in November 1964. Elly Solomon was acquitted.</p><p>After being sentenced to a $1,000 fine or 60 days in jail, Solomon took his case to state appellate court, where his conviction was overturned in February 1968.</p><p>Bruce also contested his conviction but died in August 1966 of a morphine overdose.
