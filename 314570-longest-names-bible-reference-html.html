Unfortunately, biblical names are very popular, and you are sure to find several other people named Sara, Rachael, Michael, Joseph, and the likes. Therefore, if you are looking for a unique name, you have to be a little bit more creative. So, why not go for one of the longest names in the Bible?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c769d4099fc7e89.jpg><p class=align-left>Unbeknownst to many people, there are several weirdly unique names in the Bible. We have compiled a list of some of the longest names in the Bible. If you are naming your baby, you just need to be very sure about your decision when choosing one of these names, as they might even be challenging to pronounce.</p><h2>1. Mahershalalhashbaz</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a1269eea7c3849c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Hebrew girl names with their meanings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mahershalalhashbaz is the longest name in the Bible. Found in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Isaiah 8:1, 8:3</a>, it is the name Isaiah was told by God to give to his son, who he bore with a woman only referred to in the Bible as “the Prophetess”. The name, which is symbolic in nature means “quick spoils, speedy plunder” and it is taken to have been a warning from God of what the Syrians would do the Israelites.</p><p class=align-left>Naming a baby after a character who was used to foretell of doom might not be everyone’s cup of tea. However, if you don’t mind this bit, Mahershalalhashbaz is a unique name, and you can be sure your son is the only one who will go by that name in his class.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best Bible quotes for inspiration and encouragement</p><h2>2. Chushanrishathaim</h2><p class=align-left>Chushanrishathaim is the second-longest name in the Bible. Found in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Judges 3: 8 – 10</a>, it is the name of King of Aram Nahraim, who enslaved the Israelites for 8 years after they angered God. The king, however, would not have a happy ending, as God would later raise a hero to deliver Israelites – Othniel, a relative of Caleb.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/93dacb1747b6cd46.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Royal baby Archie: First cute pictures and everything we know about Meghan and Harry's baby boy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chushanrishathaim is unique a name as they come in the Bible. However, naming your child after an oppressive ruler might not be a good idea. But then again, if you are raising them to conquer the world, why not? Just be sure to remember and consider how his story ends in the Bible before you name him.</p><h2>3. Berodachbaladan</h2><p class=align-left>Berodachbaladan is the name of a King of Babylon, who you can find in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Isaiah 39:1</a>. Originally, he was named Berodach, but after the death of his father he took on his name, Baladan, as a way to honour him.</p><p class=align-left>If you are looking for a unique kingly name for your son, Berodachbaladan is as good as any. The fact that he was respectful to his father, even in death, is a good sign for those who are superstitious. Also, he was known by another unique and long name -- Merodach-Baladan --, which means that you get a two-for-one in uniqueness with this choice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2218f5f126ce1a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny names you can only find in Africa</span></p></a><h2>4. Zaphnathpaaneah</h2><p class=align-left>Zaphnathpaaneah is one of the long religious names you can find in the Bible. Found in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Genesis 41:45</a>, it is the name that was given to Joseph by Pharaoh, the same Joseph who was sold to Egypt by his brothers, but found prosperity there.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 40 Bible verses about music that you should check out</p><p class=align-left>If you are looking for a unique name for your child, Zaphnathpaaneah is a good choice. It is especially a perfect alternative for the name Joseph, which is widely overused all over the world. Plus, you get the added benefit of an exotic Egyptian name for your child.</p><h2>5. Bashanhavothjair</h2><p class=align-left>Bashanhavothjair is another rare name in the Bible that you’ve probably never heard of, and which you will have a hard time pronouncing. Found in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> It was the name of Jair, son of Manasseh, and which would later use to name the country of Argob after he captured them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d420bf694b4d3b8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful Muslim girl names with meanings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite the nearly impossible pronunciation, Bashanhavothjair is a cool name for a baby, especially if you are looking for name ideas based on heroes. He was also a successful warrior, who conquered several lands and named them after him, so that’s another plus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a1269eea7c3849c.jpeg><h2>6. Nebuchadnezzar</h2><p class=align-left>While rare, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nebuchadnezzar</a> is a name that most people, especially those with even a little bit of Christian background, are familiar with. He is best known for being a powerful king, the greatest of all Babylonian kings.</p><p class=align-left>He rebuilt the kingdom of Babylon and restored it to its former glory after it gained its independence from Assyria. In modern history, he is credited by historians for building the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>, one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World.</p><p class=align-left>Another thing Nebuchadnezzar is known for in the Bible is his pride. In one instant, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">angered God</a> with his pride. As a result, he was cursed with madness that caused all of his kingdoms to be taken away, was driven from his lands, and forced to shelter in the jungle for seven years where he ate grass like cattle. It was not until he repented and humbled himself that the curse was lifted. His character is thus used as a moral lesson against being proud.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/769f157bb37ab788.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rules and types of fasting in the Bible</span></p></a><h2>7. Mephibosheth</h2><p class=align-left>Mephibosheth is another one of the top biblical names. It is the name of the son of Jonathan (King David’s friend) and the grandson of King Saul. The name is mentioned on a couple of occasions in the book of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Samuel</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He was crippled at a young age, when his nurse dropped him when fleeing after the news about Jonathan and Saul’s death spread. However, in later years, David remembered his promise to Jonathan, and as a result, restored his son, Mephibosheth to a high place in the palace.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Shortest and longest verses in the Bible</p><h2>8. Zerubbabel</h2><p class=align-left>If you are looking for another inspiring idea for unique biblical baby names, <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Zerubbabel</a> is a good choice. He was a heroic figure in the history of Jews, as he helped to them into victory after they were captured and enslaved by the ancient kingdom of Babylon. He is also credited with building a temple after leading the Israelites to freedom.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b9e450c1fc59e012.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35+ cute Bible baby girl names and meanings: Christian names for girls</span></p></a><h2>9. Tilgathpilneser</h2><p class=align-left>Another one of the top long Bible names, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tilgathpilneser</a> is the name of an ancient King of Assyria. He is best known for his aggressive rule, where he expanded the Assyrian empire greatly during his reign.</p><p class=align-left>If you are looking for some rare biblical names for your baby, the above are some of the longest names in the Bible. Their length alone makes them weirdly unique. However, you can also like the unique biographies of the Bible characters behind these names, from successful kings and rulers to people who overcame difficulties and prospered. However, before you choose one of these names, be sure that you know how to pronounce them; some of their pronunciation is anything but fun.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top bible scriptures on healing</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkG1scGhdobyvs8Ssq2amkaKytHnBopmlnV2nsqex0Z6lnJ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meaning-of-dancing-in-the-dark-by-frank-sinatra.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meaning of Dancing In The Dark by Frank Sinatra</a>
