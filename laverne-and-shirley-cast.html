The series starred two blue-collar women, Lavern DeFazia (Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams) working as bottle cappers for the Schotz brewery. Laverne & Shirley not only was a huge hit; but the cast and the show became a cultural phenomenon that left an indelible mark on the world of television.</p><p>The series ran for eight seasons, from 1976 to 1983 and&nbsp;was one of highest-rated sitcoms during that time. Here, we look back at the beloved Laverne & Shirley cast, with a few surprising facts that will take you back to those days of milk and Pepsi.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>Penny Marshall explained in her 2012 memoir,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">My Mother Was Nuts</a>, that the show’s opening catchphrase Schlemiel! Schlimazel! was a Yiddish song from her childhood that she and her friends would sing on their way to school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Penny Marshall as Laverne DeFazio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-side-by-side-1-5.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Penny Marshall</a> brought life to Laverne DeFazio, the tough-talking, street-smart half of the dynamic duo. With her “L” monogrammed sweaters, Laverne’s unmistakable personality made her an endearing character. The show was a spin-off from Happy Days, in which both women had recurring roles, and the chemistry between Laverne and Shirley was undeniable. In fact, the spinoff became even more popular than the original show.</p><p>After the series, Marshall continued to make her mark in Hollywood. She stepped behind the camera, becoming one of the most successful female directors in the industry. Her directorial debut, Jumpin’ Jack Flash (starring <a href=#>Whoopi Goldber</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">g</a>) was followed by iconic films like Big (starring <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a>) and A League of Their Own (starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna</a>). &nbsp;Her contributions to film have solidified her as a Hollywood legend.</p><p>Sadly, Marshall passed away in 2018, but her work continues to inspire female filmmakers to this day.</p><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> &nbsp;Penny Marshall’s brother, <a href=#>Garry Marshall</a>, who directed some of the most memorable rom-coms of all time including Pretty Woman, The Princess Diaries and The Odd Couple was the creator and executive producer of Laverne & Shirley.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cindy Williams as Shirley Feeney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-5.jpg><p>As Shirley Feeney, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cindy Williams</a> played the sweet and naive counterpart to Laverne’s brash personality. The contrast between the two friends created the perfect comedic balance.</p><p>Williams starred in seven of the eight seasons. Rumors swirled about why she left before the series ended. Then 33 years later, she revealed to the Today show that she left because of her pregnancy.</p><p>“When it came time for me to sign my contract for that season, they had me <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">working on my due date</a>,”&nbsp;said Williams. “And I said, ‘You know, I can’t sign this.’ And it went back and forth and back and forth and it just never got worked out.” She ended up suing Paramount and after a settlement, she was written out of the series. Laverne went at it alone, without her best friend, for the final 20 episodes.</p><p>Before Laverne & Shirley, Williams starred in Travels With My Aunt&nbsp;(1972), followed by the blockbuster hit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Graffiti</a>&nbsp;(1973).</p><p>After the hit sitcom, Williams became co-producer of&nbsp;Father of the Bride, starring <a href=#>Steve Martin</a>,&nbsp;in 1991 and its sequel in 1995.
