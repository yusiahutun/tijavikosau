Let’s start.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Millie Williams Bio, Early Life, Education</strong></h2><p>The beautiful Millie Williams was born Mildred “Millie” Williams on March 10, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. She reportedly had a formidable childhood in which she lived with her parents. Unfortunately, she has not revealed much about either her father or her mother.</p><p>As far as her education is concerned, she went to a local school in her hometown. Later, she attended Northwestern University, where she studied sociology, but dropped out after the first semester.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She Has Appeared In Documentaries</strong></h2><p>Millie Williams is not a professional actress but has appeared in several documentaries.

They were married for about 10 years until they divorced on 18 March 1959.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Who-Is-Millie-Williams-Relationship-With-Hugh-Hefner-More.jpg><p>But when and how did the former couple first meet? Well, they first met when they were students at Northwestern University. While they were still students, they became extremely close and started dating.</p><p>Their romantic relationship soon developed into a marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She Had Two Children With Hefner</strong></h2><p>Hugh Hefner’s first wife, Millie Williams is the mother of two children. Both of her children were born to the late Playboy founder Hefner.</p><p>Her first child, a daughter named Christie Hefner, was born on 8 November 1952. Three years later, on 30 August 1955, her second child, a son, David Hefner, was born.</p><p>All her children are well-settled and successful in their professions. In fact, Christie manages her family business very well. As reported, from 1988 to 2008, she was the President of Playboy Enterprises, Inc. CEO and Chairman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why Did Millie Williams Divorce Hefner?</strong></h2><p>As reported, Millie Williams and Hugh’s marriage broke down due to their infidelity. This was at a time when the couple was not yet married and Hefner was serving in the army when Millie was involved in an affair.</p><p>Guilt over her infidelity led her to allow Hefner to continue his extramarital affair after the marriage. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Reporter</a> covered the story years later when Millie admitted her mistake,</p><p>Hef’s first real heartbreak came prior to tying the knot, when Williams admitted to engaging in an affair during his time in the Army. In an attempt to lessen her guilt and save their relationship, Williams allowed the future mogul to become involved with other women during their marriage.</p><p>Later, Hefner also commented on how devastating the news of his wife’s affair had been. He declared that he had abstained from sexual relations with other women and saved himself for his wife. He said,</p><p>I had literally saved myself for my wife, but after we had sex she told me that she’d had an affair. That was the most devastating moment in my life. My wife was more sexually experienced than I was. After that, I always felt in a sense that the other guy was in bed with us, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mildred Williams Married Again After Divorce With Her First Husband</strong></h2><p>After her divorce from Hugh in 1959, Millie remained single for quite a long time.

The two got engaged in 1989, despite a 36-year age difference.</p><p>They had two children, Cooper Hefner and Marston Hefner. Cooper was born on 4 September 1991 and Marston on 9 April 1990. Just a few years after the birth of their children, Conrad and Hefner divorced in 1998.
