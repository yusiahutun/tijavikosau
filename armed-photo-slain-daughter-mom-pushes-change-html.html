She said she believes in the Constitutional right to bear arms and doesn't consider this a gun-control debate. She's in a motorcycle club that includes friends who are NRA-certified firearms instructors. She believes the cause is about better regulating guns and ensuring that the people who own them are responsible.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What she wants is universal background checks, including at gun shows and in private sales between individuals.

Phillips can't bear to view the autopsy photos that were taken of her daughter. She was among Aurora victims' relatives who pushed the court to seal them so they wouldn't show up on the Internet.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'We knew we had to have our daughter cremated because the wounds were so bad,' Phillips said, 'and that's all I need to know.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Phillips, a gun owner who lives in Texas, said it's important for people to know what happens when someone is shot.
