With her signature crumpled blonde curls and urban-bohemian aesthetic, designer Veronica Swanson Beard, 32, is part of just such a clan: the San Francisco–raised Swanson sisters. (Their family is widely recognized as the frozen-food scions who revolutionized dinnertime post–World War II.) Beard's equally stylish siblings, known by their married names, Alexis Swanson Traina and Claiborne Swanson Frank, are among her biggest fans. "Veronica is the kind of girl who doesn't look for approval from others," says eldest sister Traina, who is the creative director of the family's current business, Swanson Vineyards, in California's Napa Valley. "She just has a quiet confidence that is so refreshing. She's never hip or trendy, just cool." Perhaps that subtle sophistication is one of the reasons you're more likely to find her hosting rooftop barbecues than on the host committee for one of New York's frequent galas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not that firing up the range means evenings at home are any less chic. By day, Beard's husband, Jamie, is COO of an investment-research company, but in their abode he's known as a grill master who has an affinity for Lobel's steaks. The young couple's groovy outdoor gatherings typically attract a crowd that will stay long into the night. "We have a huge table that can easily seat 10, but we've had nearly 50 for dinner up there," says Beard. "Up there" refers to that white whale of Manhattan real estate, the penthouse terrace. Theirs is decorated in a thick maze of azaleas, peonies, and tulips. It's the crowning glory of the three-floor Greenwich Village apartment they share with their curly-haired sons, Clarke, four, and Halsey, two. The couple have sought that balance of rowdy but refined since their New Orleans wedding, a full-blown Southern extravaganza, in 2004. "It was so great," says Beard with a smile. "We had amazing live music every night."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not surprisingly, throwing intimate at-home affairs is a family trait. "Our mother is arguably the best host in America," proclaims Frank, the youngest of the trio and a budding photographer, about the free-spirited Elizabeth Swanson. "I see so many of her talents in Veronica, from the flower arrangements to the hors d'oeuvres to the china." Like Mom's, Beard's tastes aren't precious but do require colorful, well-thought-out details. She prefers brightly patterned Mottahedeh Tobacco Leaf china, bouquets of gardenias ("I can whip up a great arrangement from the deli!" she boasts), and Diptyque's Figuier and Coriandre candles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All of the finishing touches add an extra layer to Beard's already lush and staunchly antiminimalist decor. The work of interior designer and family friend Thomas Britt, the 4,000-square-foot home, into which they moved in 2006, is a mosaic of vibrantly hued walls, exotic printed fabrics, art (her husband's uncle is legendary photographer-artist-diarist Peter Beard), and a measured dash of whimsy. "We knew we needed somebody to help us with the place, and he was the only and obvious choice," she explains. "I love his style. I love his use of color. I'm a huge color person; I could never live in a beige apartment." True to her words, Beard selected glossy turquoise for her kitchen walls, a plummy-pink upholstery for the master bedroom, and hits of wild animal spots throughout the space. "With Tom, I knew we would get all the punch we wanted and not regret it in a few years," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bold choices like these make Beard who she is. But when it comes to her personal style, she goes for a fine balance of designer flash and casual finesse. When she's not dressed up in Lanvin, Isabel Marant, or Céline, she prefers the low- key simplicity of J Brand jeans, plain white Hanes tees, and anything J. Crew. But the label you'll catch her in most often these days is her own, called Veronica Beard. The line is actually doubly eponymous, though. She founded the label in 2009 with her sister-in-law, who has, in a star crossed coincidence, nearly the same name: Veronica Miele Beard. Together, they've developed a well-rounded set of casually chic tailored separates like convertible collegiate blazers with changeable knit liners, printed day dresses, and a navy linen motorcycle jacket. "Our working relationship is the ultimate yin and yang," says Miele Beard, a former investment banker who complements Beard's slightly more laid-back manner. But both found a desire for a no-nonsense fashion uniform out of necessity. Between the two of them, they have seven children. "We do a lot of work after the kids are in bed!" says Miele Beard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This dedication has taken the two Veronica's quite far in a short period of time. They count as a fan no less a fashion potentate than Gwyneth Paltrow. "I think that people are attracted to the fact that we are not trained designers but we're trying to find things that we actually love," Beard says. "We road-test everything." Beard's skill set does extend beyond fashion and furnishing. To wit, she and her husband hold impromptu arts and crafts classes in their boys' playroom, where the walls are covered in homemade projects. However, she admits that her fabulous talents end where the kitchen begins. "I am a terrible cook. Il Cantinori now has the Jamie and Veronica special," she jokes about the venerable old-school Italian restaurant right across the street from their home. Even without the Batali-like skills, Beard's colorful life—with an up-and-coming clothing line, ultrachic sister act, and truly fabulous flat—is red-hot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGihnqmys7XOq6pmnZ6psrPAwKKloqaXZK6lwsicnGiZaGaEcMLEq6anoZOWerTDwKeqqKZdl7KivsNmoKeslafDqrHWZmhpaWFk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./5-skin-treatments-you-should-avoid-during-summer-ipl-sessions-and-chemical-peels-sclerotherapy-body.html>&#171;&nbsp;5 skin treatments you should avoid during the summer: from IPL sessions and chemical peels to sclero</a>
