When your travel plans extend a long holiday weekend or less, there’s no need to bust out heavy and bulky rolling luggage — instead, reach for a weekender bag. Typically in the form of a duffle or tote (and, sometimes, a backpack), they’re much <strong>more compact than the average trolly</strong> and usually can only hold a few days’ worth of belongings or less, depending on its size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good weekender bag should be functional, specifically for the trip in question and your personal needs. Will you need to pack bulkier items, like sweaters and boots? Are you a habitual overpacker who needs extra room? Of course, there are a few universal characteristics that any weekender bag should have, no matter the trip in question: It should have<strong> a variety of different pockets, compartments, and dividers</strong> to keep your belongings organized and accessible; it should be<strong> </strong>crafted from <strong>a durable material</strong> that protects your things and won’t rip, tear, or wear out over time; and it should be <strong>comfortable and easy to carry</strong> because no one wants a backache after navigating the maze that is an airport terminal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We put more than 30 of today’s top-rated weekender bags to the test to see which ones are worth the hype. We took a lot of factors into consideration when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>testing</a> each bag — not only its capacity to hold all of the necessities on our list, but also its <strong>durability, portability, organizational features, and overall design and value</strong>. We also tapped a team of expert accessories designers and fashion stylists to weigh in and share their tips for choosing the right style.

On the outside, it keeps things simple with a<strong> single zippered pocket and simple slip pockets</strong> on the remaining sides, while the inside has a total of five pockets (one zippered, two mesh, and two elastic), a velcro padded laptop pocket that <strong>can fit up to a 15-inch laptop</strong> on top of its capacious main compartment, and a luggage handle sleeve longer. Regarding its durability, we found that the design was top-notch quality and never once worried the nylon body could rip — we even dropped it four times and found that there was no damage whatsoever — and found the webbing along the inner pockets to be impressively heavy duty. Moreover, since most of the bag is nylon, it comes with a much more reasonable price tag than its leather counterparts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we were super pleased with this duffle, our only qualm being that the bag itself, empty, is on the heavier side. But even though we found it slightly cumbersome at times, it’s still comfortable to carry thanks to the webbed, padded shoulder strap, so the extra weight was in no way a dealbreaker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon body, polyurethane trim, polyester lining | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 21 (L) x 8 (W) x 11.5 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>24.22 L | <strong>Other features: </strong>Adjustable/removable padded strap, 4 exterior pockets, 5 interior pockets, luggage handle sleeve, laptop pocket with velcro closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-compartments-lo--sons-catalina-supreme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Compartments</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lo & Sons Catalina Supreme</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lo &amp;amp; Sons The Catalina Supreme" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jJnaPWddTlaZcL5hD0-b-53xyOs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lo--sons-the-catalina-supreme-d6f827569e6e4cb28b1eb145b2b5b72e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lo & Sons</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It boasts plenty of thoughtful organizational compartments, like customizable velcro dividers and a bottom pocket.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The extra-large design can be a little awkward to carry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going away for a longer period — think four days or more — a bag that’s spacious and has ample organization features will be your best friend, ensuring your things stay neat, orderly, and easy to find (nobody wants to dig through multiple days of outfits just to find their toothbrush). This luxe multifunctional bag from Lo & Sons is exactly that, boasting so. Many. Compartments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to a litany of interior pockets and an exterior <strong>16-inch laptop sleeve</strong>, we appreciated the thoughtful expandable bottom pocket, which is ideal for storing things we’d want to keep separate, like shoes. Another boon is the customizable padded divider, which allowed us to adjust the interior compartment sizing to fit our needs. The one thing to keep in mind is that, given its spacious interior and many pocket organizers, the bag is big. While this deems it extra useful for longer trips, we found that, at times, it is somewhat awkward — even tiring — to carry. Still<strong>, the shoulder strap with adjustable padding makes for comfortable wear, </strong>so we didn’t experience any digging or achy shoulders, even when we did stuff it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At $350, this bag is a bit pricey, and frankly, we think it’s a little steep for what you get. But if you’re an organization buff (or a Virgo) willing to splurge a little, this is the bag for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester exterior, cactus leather handles | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>19.7 (L) x 9.5 (W) 15.5 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>27.9 L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>One adjustable/removable padded strap, exterior laptop pocket, one multi-purpose exterior strap, expandable bottom compartment, luggage handle sleeve, multiple interior pockets</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-quince-italian-leather-triple-compartment-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Triple Compartment Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince Italian Leather Triple Compartment Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/InTSxc5_eaLF1nxBhaoMddwacKE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince-italian-leather-triple-compartment-weekender-1db23bda54cc48c1bb15ae04319e2cf1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It doesn’t look like a weekender, but rather an oversized purse.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some pockets are too narrow or unequipped to organize small items.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your weekender bag doesn’t *just* need to be a vessel for carrying all of your vacation needs — it can be just as stylish as the rest of your accessories, too. One of the things we really loved about this leather weekender is that, well, <strong>it doesn’t look like a weekender,</strong> but rather a sleek oversized <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>purse</a>. It’s constructed with beautiful Italian leather that we found to be quite durable — we dropped it three times, and it showed no damage or scratches whatsoever. It’s “heavy” in a way that a quality leather bag would be, but it was still <strong>comfortable to carry up and down the stairs.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s <strong>the perfect size for a two-day getaway,</strong> and its many compartments and pockets help keep things separated (though some of them are too narrow, and there weren’t enough options for small items like keys). At the same time, we’d need something a bit more spacious for longer trips or winter getaways where we’d be packing bulkier clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, it’s one of the more expensive bags on this list, but we were impressed enough to deem it worth its over-$200 price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material</strong>: Italian leather body, cotton twill lining | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>20.5 (L) x 6.5 (W) x 13 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Other Features: </strong>3 zipper compartments, center compartment with 3 slip pockets and one zip pocket, luggage handle sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-expandable-longchamp-le-pliage-21-inch-expandable-travel-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Expandable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Longchamp Le Pliage 21-Inch Expandable Travel Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Longchamp Le Pliage 21-Inch Expandable Travel Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ftzryO_ac6rMV93sfARodSixgss=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/longchamp-le-pliage-21-inch-expandable-travel-bag-1cdeb7e259f548328cde8b9ca3f4deb4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s super roomy, and when fully expanded, it could fit enough for a four-day trip or more.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s lacking organizers and pockets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Weekender bags that can expand are super handy, allowing you to use them for a multitude of travel situations, whether a 48-hour work trip or skipping town for a few days with friends. That’s where Longchamp’s Le Pliage 21-inch expandable bag comes in (which, yes, is essentially a giant version of the iconic, celeb-loved tote).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bag is spacious. We found that when the middle section was unzipped and the bag was fully expanded,<strong> </strong>there was more than enough room for everything we needed for a four-day trip. When it’s zipped up to its smallest size, it was the perfect size for a two-day trip. It’s made from that same <strong>durable, water-resistant nylon</strong> we all know and love, keeping things nice and light despite its size. It comes with a removable shoulder strap, but we also appreciate that the top handles are large enough to squeeze our arms through to wear on our shoulders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s pricey, but we can attest to the brand’s totes holding up for years, so<strong> we think it’s a worthy investment given its longevity and durability.</strong> Plus, you’re basically getting two bags in one — what’s not to love? The only thing we think can be improved is its lack of organizers and pockets — it’s essentially one giant compartment with one small interior pocket, so we recommend investing in some packing cubes if you like to keep things needed and orderly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Water-resistant nylon body; leather trim and handles | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.75 (L) x 9 (W) x 20.5 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>XL | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Adjustable/removable strap, interior wall pocket, water-resistant lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-rothys-the-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rothy’s The Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rothy&amp;acirc;s The Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BYggfVesN_D3HP1st4D-LZP5WII=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rothys-the-weekender-8da463173d1c40aaafa3ea61956efe79.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rothyâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s spacious, stylish, and machine washable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have an exterior pocket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we’re going to shell out on a weekender bag, it needs to be durable, functional, and a style we’d want to show off. This travel bag from Rothys is just that: It’s clean and minimalist on the outside, crafted from the brand’s sturdy signature recycled plastic (and machine-washable!) knit, and the interior is designed with <strong>multiple compartments and pockets</strong> to keep our goods organized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found it to be the perfect size — it’s large, but <strong>not so large that it's cumbersome</strong>, and we could easily pack it with several days’ worth of necessities, so long as we don’t need to pack anything overly bulky. The thick, structured fabric did a great job at keeping our belongings protected even through a drop test, but even empty, it has some weight. The adjustable shoulder strap allowed for comfortable carrying when walking short distances — however, anything longer than 10–15 minutes would start to feel too heavy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we scored this bag high, but if there were one thing we could change, we’d add an exterior zippered pocket for easy access to our phones, keys, and wallets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled plastic | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>21.5 (L) x 8.9 (W) x 13.8 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Double-zipper top closure, padded handles, adjustable/removable shoulder strap, 1 magnetic side compartment with interior zipper pocket, 1 zipper side compartment for laptop</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-small-calpak-luka-duffel-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Small</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calpak Luka Duffel Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calpak Luka Duffel Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7LN4HmU9RP1DeGYBCqmJjQZ-i-E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calpak-luka-duffel-72dbda522ad4485c9cec2d1963e8e25c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calpak</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s compact yet surprisingly roomy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have a laptop sleeve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For shorter trips — or longer vacations that require packing nothing more than a couple of bikinis and a bottle of SPF&nbsp;— you don’t need to go overboard with an oversized weekender.

The luggage handle sleeve also makes it convenient for plopping on top of your carry-on roller bag as your personal item (yep, it’s that small). The bag is also <strong>extremely light, making it easy to grab on the go.</strong> We wouldn’t go as far as to say the water-resistant polyester is more durable than other bags we’ve tried, but it passed the drop test with flying colors, keeping our belongings protected and not showing any signs of outer damage. It can be worn multiple ways thanks to shoulder straps and a <strong>removable crossbody stra</strong>p — though we think the shoulder straps are ten times more comfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we think it’s a great bag, but we wouldn’t mind if it also included a padded laptop sleeve. Ringing in at under $150, it’s one of the more affordable options out there, but given the material, we expected the price to be even lower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>16 (L) x 7 (W) x 12 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>22 L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Adjustable/removable strap,<strong> </strong>8 pockets (interior and exterior), shoe compartment, luggage handle sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-canvas-mark--graham-beckett-waxed-canvas-and-leather-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Canvas</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mark & Graham Beckett Waxed Canvas and Leather Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mark &amp;amp; Graham Beckett Waxed Canvas and Leather Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3EXfAJ_lz40xqbnm0vcSljE6AD0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2024-01-24T075214.319-699298b93bab4af888d6e29f81a3934e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mark & Graham</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s lightweight yet durable and functional.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It could use more interior organizers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Canvas is another popular material used in travel bags due to its durability and the fact that it’s not as heavy as leather. This bag from Mark & Graham provides the best of both worlds: a lightweight waxed canvas body with leather trims that lend a sense of luxury.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the first things we noticed is that the <strong>wax coating</strong> isn’t solely for aesthetic purposes; it also adds an extra layer of durability to the design. It held up well throughout our various tests, and the waxed surface prevented any wear and tear from showing, making it well worth its price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also comfortable — in fact, we thought it was more comfortable than nylon. Despite packing it with a few days’ worth of stuff (which fit perfectly, mind you)<strong>, its thick canvas straps make carrying easy</strong>, and we’d think it’s important to particularly call out how comfortable the longer strap was for our shoulders and how well it wore on a shorter torso. This bag could easily be carried through the airport all day with ease, in our opinion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also love the look of this bag — it’s something that a “chic Indiana Jones” might carry; it feels both adventurous and professional with a masculine vibe. While we wouldn’t be mad if it had more interior organizers like a shoe compartment, overall, it’s a solid bag that served us well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Waxed canvas and leather body; cotton twill interior; brass hardware | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>21 (L) x 10 (W) x 12 (H)&nbsp; inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Removable padded strap, interior and exterior zipper pockets, interior padded laptop sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-minimalist-monos-metro-carry-all-duffel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Minimalist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Monos Metro Carry-All Duffel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Monos Metro Carry-All Duffel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6BoUOeKeS2MjCQf9Bg2JbDrWdJY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/monos-metro-carry-all-duffel--74e8ea7ceec24b90ae14eb1a0dbb0641.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Monos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Sleek in design, it’s surprisingly deep and spacious.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The shoulder strap is somewhat flimsy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a bag that seamlessly blends into your travel ensemble, we’re big fans of this minimalist duffle from Monos. It’s roomy enough for an extended weekend trip, yet portable —<strong> </strong>it’s <strong>sturdy </strong>and maintains its <strong>rigid shape</strong> when empty, but it’s <strong>not at all heavy</strong>. The bag’s rounded silhouette and top zipper create a wide opening that makes packing a breeze, while interior pockets make its large main compartment easy to keep organized. The exterior features a luggage sleeve that can convert into a sleeve pocket, which we found to be really convenient, and we appreciated the spacious button pockets that can be found on each end of the bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From a durability standpoint, the bag itself is of superior quality. The faux leather material is thick and substantial yet flexible enough for comfortable wear, and after multiple tests, <strong>there were no signs of any wear or damage</strong>. The area that needs some improvement is its shoulder strap — it didn’t feel as high quality as the rest of the bag, and it seemed to have slightly frayed during the testing period, leaving us curious how much of a problem it would become over time with more use. Still, we found this bag to be elegant, high-quality, and worthy of its luxury-leaning price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Vegan leather body, cotton twill lining | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>20 (L) x 10.4 (W) x 12 (H)&nbsp; inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>27.3 L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Two-way zipper closure, 16-inch laptop compartment, interior zipper pocket, tech sleeve pockets, water bottle pocket, exterior magnetic pockets, luggage handle sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-extra-large-bellroy-classic-weekender-45l></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Extra-Large</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bellroy Classic Weekender 45L</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bellroy Classic Weekender 45L" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y5_IgvHCl8p0fG8G2W3DJpflVyw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bellroy-classic-weekender-45l-duffel-bag---slate-bf1a4a5844f64641a1c84c66f31dd45c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s huge but not at all heavy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the removable strap didn’t clip diagonally across the zipper and the bag clips were sturdier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, you need to pack a lot for a short trip, whether you’re traveling to a cold destination requiring many layers or your itinerary is filled with different events and activities involving multiple outfit changes. That’s where this extra-large duffel comes in — it may look unsophisticated at first glance, but it’s actually quite impressive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, it’s huge. We packed enough for a four-day trip — including two pairs of shoes — and still had plenty of room to spare. While its spacious interior didn’t include as many organizers as other bags on this list, the large exterior zipper pocket, two inner pouches, and small interior compartment made it <strong>easy to access important items,</strong> no matter how stuffed the bag was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite its generous <strong>45L capacity</strong>, it was still incredibly <strong>comfortable to carry</strong>. We noticed that larger bags tend to feel bulky and heavy when carried crossbody, but we were impressed by how lightweight and comfortable this bag was. The recycled polyester body kept our belongings safe and showed no signs of wear and tear after the testing period, though we wish the strap clips were made from metal rather than plastic, ensuring stronger durability. For under $200, this bag is a reasonable option for chronic overpackers and others with lengthier packing lists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled PET plastic polyester | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>650 (L) x 380 (W) x 400 (H) millimeters | <strong>Capacity: </strong>45 L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Removable padded strap, external key-clip pocket, internal slip pockets, internal AirTag pocket, raised mesh zip pocket for valuables, luggage handle sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-convertible-dagne-dover-lagos-convertible-duffle-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Convertible</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dagne Dover Lagos Convertible Duffle Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dagne Dover Lagos Convertible Duffel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-7pvb5UjL7pnYGtGfdo2G21qA_U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dagne--dover-lagos-convertible-duffel-a45b96760a5c4e9db015d2a44c478797.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dagne Dover</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This duffle-backpack hybrid contains so many pockets and compartments for organized packing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It comes in medium and large, and we wish it came in a small option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a lot to love about this sturdy duffle bag, which earned a perfect score across all categories. For one, it’s designed with plenty of organization features — think multiple interior and exterior pockets (some with pockets within pockets!), a laptop sleeve, a removable shoe bag, and various liners and straps to hang other items via carabiners. It’s also <strong>extremely durable,</strong> protecting our stuff and itself through numerous drop tests; we have good reason to believe it would last a decade of regular use with no issues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this bag stand out is its convertible features. While it comes with the usual <strong>top handles and removable crossbody strap</strong> you’ll find with most weekenders, it also boasts removable padded backpack straps (which are easily packed into their own little zippered pockets), a boon for when it’s filled with heavier goods or we’re on the run.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ringing in at just over $300, it’s not the most budget-friendly option, but given its size, durability, convertibility, and sheer amount of organizational features, it’s well worth the price. It’s by no means a simple design, but we think it makes the perfect bag for the frequent traveler who needs to stay organized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled 900D polyester body, Repreve recycled polyester lining, color-plated zinc alloy hardware | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>16 (L) x 11 (W) x 11 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>32 L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Adjustable/removable crossbody strap, detachable padded neoprene strap wrap, padded backpack straps, detachable key leash, 13-inch laptop sleeve, shoe compartment, multiple interior and exterior pockets, luggage handle sleeve</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-personal-item-july-carry-all-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Personal Item</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>July Carry All Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="July Carry All Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TGC_Pe9GIUiWxS1X40lJZBm2n7g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/july-carry-all-weekender-1e4161ea81d14489bd9704e646d2763c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>July</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s durable, functional, and will fit underneath the standard economy seat.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It could use more organizers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another bag we felt deserved high marks this carry-all from buzzy travel brand July.

Crafted from a quality nylon twill, it passed all durability tests, and we think that even if it did get scuffed or dirty,<strong> it would be easy to wipe clean.</strong> The padded shoulder strap and leather-lined tote straps are comfortable for over-the-shoulder carrying, and the luggage sleeve makes it easy to stack on top of our carry-on rollers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we wouldn’t mind a few additional pockets and compartments for organizing, we think it’s a versatile bag adept for multiple modes of transportation, flights included — and well worth the <strong>$200 price tag</strong>. Remember, this is a personal item-sized bag, so you’re not going to squeeze in more than a couple of days’ worth of belongings. We found that it was best for an overnight trip, a two-night trip at the most; it was somewhat hard to zipper shut after with all our items packed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Twill nylon body; leather handles and trims | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>18 (L) x 8.5 (W) x 10.5 (H) inches | <strong>Capacity: </strong>28L | <strong>Other Features: </strong>Adjustable/removable shoulder strap, exterior zip pocket with two internal compartments, internal dividers and zipped pockets, 16-inch padded laptop pocket, luggage handle sleeve, external D-rings for attachments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-duffle-aer-travel-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Duffle</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aer Travel Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aer Travel Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Miw0_1otJBVHnr64KiTWKVFuXt8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aer--travel-weekender--474d2e66e66842dda48fac4f5499ada9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aer&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a timeless utilitarian appeal.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not as lightweight as some other options on this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This weekender is a solid option for longer trips: The medium-sized bag easily fits all items on our four-day packing list with some room to spare.

We found it <strong>comfortable to carry short distances</strong> thanks to <strong>cushioned straps</strong>, but it does get pretty heavy when packed to the brim, and it would probably start to get uncomfortable over long periods.

Common weekend bag materials include nylon, neoprene, leather, canvas, and polyester, explains fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Audree Kate López</a>. If you want a resilient, lightweight, and water-resistant bag you can clean easily and store away when you’re not using, accessories design consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Neerja Jindal</a> considers nylon your best option. Personal stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Desiree Miranda</a> is partial to neoprene for its softness, water resistance, and ability to hold its shape over time. Leather has a luxe look and feel and is quite durable, but it’s not waterproof and can’t always be squeezed into tight spaces like nylon or neoprene. Canvas is another hardwearing option, and we love that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mark & Graham’s Canvas Beckett Weekender</a> adds an extra layer of durability with a wax coating.</li><li><strong>Size and Capacity: </strong>Next, you’ll want to ensure your bag is large and spacious enough to fit all your things, which will vary based on factors like where you’re headed and how long you’ll be there. A good rule of thumb? “It should be able to carry all travel-related essentials for 24-48 hours,” says Jindal. While dimensions matter here, depth and capacity are the most important. “I find that some bags are too narrow or not flexible enough to stuff everything in, so you want to make sure the space of the actual bag actually suits your needs,” López says.</li><li><strong>Organizational Compartments: </strong>The experts agree that the more pockets, compartments, and other organizational features, the better. Outer slip and zippered pockets are great for quick, easy access to important items — think grabbing for your passport as you approach the TSA agent — while inner compartments and dividers will make the packing, unpacking, and repacking process much easier. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Elizabeth Money</a>, Senior Vice President of Brand and Creative at BÉIS, recommends looking for products that feature details like padded laptop pockets and key leashes to keep your belongings neat and accessible. (The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BÉIS The Commuter Duffle</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lo & Sons The Catalina Supreme</a> are two bags designed with a litany of organizers.)</li><li><strong>Padded Handles and Straps: </strong>Many weekender bag styles come with two strap options: top handles for carrying by hand and a longer shoulder strap for when you need to be hands-free. When you’re running through the train station or simply lugging your bag up a few flights of stairs, the shoulder strap will come in handy — but the heavier your bag, the more likely it is to cause shoulder pain. Padded straps will ensure they don’t dig, no matter how many pairs of shoes you’ve stuffed into your bag. Look for padded top handles, too, notes Jindal: “A fully-loaded bag can end up weighing quite a bit, so soft and padded grab handles will help prevent pain.” The many straps on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=8 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dagne Dover Large Lagos Convertible Duffle</a> are padded, allowing for comfortable carrying, whether worn over your shoulder or as a backpack.</li><li><strong>Ease of Use: </strong>A weekender bag is for more than just a short road trip. All four experts consider a luggage handle sleeve a non-negotiable for air travel. “This is one of the most important features, in my opinion, given that most people have a trolley bag and use a weekender as cabin luggage,” says Jindal. “Carrying both separately can be painful; with this feature, the luggage is not only a breeze to carry but is compact as one piece.” (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=9 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CALPAK’s Luka Duffel</a> is among the many on our list with this feature.)<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How big should a weekender bag be?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“In general, it should be <strong>big enough to hold all of your essentials for a short trip away,</strong> yet small enough to throw over your shoulder if need be,” says Miranda. “The ideal dimensions would be around 16 inches long, 9 inches wide, and 11 inches high.” Of course, how big of a weekender bag you’ll need will depend on where you’re going, how long you’re going for, and what kind of clothing and accessories you’ll need to pack — you’ll need more room for bulky sweaters than you will for skimpy bikinis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some folks who tend to overpack may lean towards larger bags, but if you do, López recommends ensuring it’s <strong>no larger than a carry-on suitcase</strong>. “This way, you can use it when traveling by plane,” she says. “A standard carry-on is 22–24 inches long, 14–16 inches wide, and 9–11 inches high.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can a weekender bag be used as your personal item on a flight?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, it can, depending on the dimensions of your bag, says López. You’ll first want to confirm the exact dimensions of your bag and then double-check the allotted dimensions and weight considered personal by the airline you’re flying. A good rule of thumb is to <strong>keep it 18 inches long, 14 inches wide, and 8 inches high or lower. </strong>Dimensions aside, it’ll need to fit underneath the seat in front of you, which is where material comes into play. “The softer and less structured the bag, the more likely it’ll be able to fit,” says Miranda. López says you might still get away with taking a structured leather or canvas bag, but it might not fit as easily (and you don’t want to risk permanently changing its shape).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you pack a weekender bag?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like packing your roller luggage can constitute a game of Tetris, so can packing your weekender bag. Given that weekender bags are less structured than hard luggage, you’ll want to be extra careful about <strong>the order in which you pack things</strong> — not just for accessibility purposes, but to keep your things protected from getting squished or crushed, too. “If your weekend bag is the only bag you’re bringing, the best way to start is by adding <strong>one or two pairs of shoes [your heaviest items] on the bottom,</strong>” says Miranda. “Next, add the two or three outfits you’ll need, followed by essential toiletries on top. If you’re using it as a personal item on your flight, I suggest packing everything you’ll need easy access to while traveling — a book, snacks, laptop, etc.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Igneri</a> is a freelance writer who has been working in fashion and beauty media for over a decade.
