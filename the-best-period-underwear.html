<strong>moisture-wicking fabrics</strong>, are game changers. The washable <strong>reusable undergarments </strong>ditch the amount of waste we create from disposable products, can hold more blood than regular tampons, and certain styles are significantly <strong>more comfortable</strong> than other feminine products. The result? Peace of mind and time back in our days. Beyond that, brands offer them in nearly every style, including <strong>boxers</strong>, <strong>briefs</strong>, and even <strong>thongs</strong> (yes, really), so there are options for every situation and every type of flow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, between the different types of silhouettes, fabrics, and absorbency levels to choose from, exploring this option will look a little different for everyone. To find the best ones for your individual experience, we sent <strong>46 pairs</strong> of the most popular period underwear to our New York City-based testing lab and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we tested them</a> by simulating real-world situations using teaspoons of water and filter paper. From there we assessed each pair of panties based on how much liquid they held before leaking, whether the material was soft and breathable, and durability (did they hold up after washing?). Then, we consulted two board-certified gynecologists and a nurse practitioner to answer every question about how period panties work and what to consider before purchasing a pair.<br></p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Editor's Note</span><p>We've seen the recent allegations and lawsuit settlement with Thinx that claims the brand's organic cotton underwear contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (also known as PFAS), which have been linked to various health concerns, like cancer, and Agion antimicrobial treatment. Thinx denies these allegations and does not admit wrongdoing.</p><p>We are currently conducting research by interviewing experts to educate ourselves on the topic and will update this story with further information.

Additionally, it held up to <strong>four teaspoons of fluid</strong>, about four tampons worth, which is an impressive amount considering costs less than its competitors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, the fabric is a tad bulkier than your average panty, but we appreciated that it <strong>hugged close to our silhouette</strong> for extra security and support. That said, you may find this tighter fit means you need to size up. On that note, the brand offers the underwear in sizes<strong> up to 4X </strong>— a win for size inclusivity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Heavy | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–4X | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5792 data-sizes=750px alt="Thinx For All Super Absorbency Brief" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wIZe0HvJtFwPptZRQ4YeOj8-85s=/fit-in/1500x5792/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-period-underwear-test-thinx-all-super-absorbency-brief-lalmeida-9631.jpg-3dc1bf6579eb42d89fc05448fa8f49d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Leticia Almeida</span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=5792 data-sizes=750px alt="Thinx For All Super Absorbency Brief" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/U8Vh-Sg3x99w4Yc3N3O_-cpRcXY=/fit-in/1500x5792/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-period-underwear-test-thinx-all-super-absorbency-brief-lalmeida-9629.jpg-6a15fab39778483d859c52f87b728784.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Leticia Almeida</span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-aeriereal-period-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AerieREAL Period Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AerieREAL Period Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0e-n6So_UC3SYN2SnAANVMMWO4I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aeriereal-period-underwear-8589902dd2394d739dad5cee57464762.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aerie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> They’re an affordable option that works great for light to medium flow days.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The gusset reaches to the back of the underwear and could feel diaper-like to some wearers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re thrilled Aerie’s period underwear lives up to the same standards as its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>comfortable bras</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>underwear</a> we wear everywhere, and at the affordable price, we’ve come to expect from the intimates brand too. The period underwear features a super <strong>stretchy, non-constricting waistband and panty line</strong>, and <strong>breathable</strong>, buttery <strong>soft jersey fabric</strong> that’s comfortable to sit, walk and play in, especially with the extra support the extended gusset provides. Though depending on your preference some wearers may find this design detail to have a diaper-adjacent feel, but it didn’t bother us. However, either way, we’ll likely save this underwear for wearing around the house or near the end of our cycle when our flow is lighter because it wasn’t the most absorbent option we tried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Light to medium | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, acrylic, polyester, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-proof-leakproof-high-waisted-lace-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Proof Leakproof High Waisted Lace Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Proof Leakproof High Waisted Lace Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6osef0xiYZIxF6Ni0AMPMMD2EsM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/proof-leak-proof-high-waisted-lace-brief-98a0005c25ae421aa1ba2a1adc3b9003.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Proof</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> For being a more stylistic choice, we were very impressed by how well they absorbed fluid.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The structured waistband doesn’t have much give for bloating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, period underwear can be functional and stylish. These panties are well worth the price tag simply because their chic look allows you to wear them on and off your period. They feature <strong>silky fabric</strong>, a <strong>cheeky fit,</strong> and <strong>breathable lace mesh inserts,</strong> dashing any of our preconceived notions that period underwear is strictly utilitarian. Despite their deceptively delicate appearance, they were <strong>ultra-absorbent</strong>. Seriously, we wouldn’t be afraid to wear them during our heaviest flows, but we’d skip them on days we’re prone to bloating because the waistband isn’t very stretchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Medium | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, spandex, nylon | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thong-knix-leakproof-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Thong</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix Leakproof Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix Leakproof Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vdpho4wCv5Zi81s1Tpmop8P93YA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Knix-Leakproof-Thong-1339a73dbc774dbbb0054570c6e8c46e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The skimpy silhouette was surprisingly absorbent, and it felt secure and more comfortable than a traditional thong.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They are better saved for lighter flows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As much as we love how the best thongs prevent VPLS, the phrase “period thong,” doesn’t inspire much confidence in us, but the Knix Leakproof Thong exceeded our expectations. The panties quickly absorbed liquid, the outer gusset stayed completely dry, and we saw <strong>no spillover</strong>. Though we probably wouldn’t risk wearing it during the first couple of days of our cycle, its<strong> seamless design</strong> makes it a great backup option if we want to wear tighter-fitting clothing, like say for a special event, and don’t have enough confidence in a pad or tampon alone. Additionally, between the 10 sophisticated modish shades to choose from and <strong>smooth, velvety fabric</strong>, these panties are luxe enough to double as everyday underwear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Light | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–4X | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, spandex, nylon | <strong>Colors:</strong> 17</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bikini-cora-period-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cora Period Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cora Period Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vNV7WM946T2lwJQrIUYWs9AjXeE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cora-period-underwear-0bb3e766408e482aa618740ec6cff6d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These bikini-style panties give you the look and feel of regular, everyday underwear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The gusset isn’t full-coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Being on our cycle is uncomfortable enough without our underwear reminding us that it’s there every five seconds, which is why we’re thankful Cora Period Underwear provides a comfortable <strong>bikini-cut</strong> option that disguises itself under clothing. The <strong>breathable 100 percent cotton fabric</strong> provides plenty of airflow for a fresh feel, and its <strong>firm elastic waistband</strong> sits snug and secure against our bodies, while still having plenty of give for the inevitable bloating. The best part? The gusset still felt dry holding up to <strong>three tampons worth of fluid</strong>, making it a great contender for heavier flows. Keep in mind this underwear style provides a little less coverage than other options, but it does remain discreet every time we wear tighter jeans and skirts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Medium | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saalt-leakproof-high-waist-period-underwear></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saalt Leakproof High Waist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saalt Leakproof High Waist Period Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/34zyy2m6b59JjVuJwMxhWV4-C-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/saalt-leakproof-high-waist-a911cd4d70314543a8a0170ce610bc4c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saalt</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These Saalt briefs boast an elegant style, challenging what we think when we hear the words “period underwear.”</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The ribbed gusset stops a bit short in the back, leaving you susceptible to potential leakage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Saalt Leakproof High Waist Brief is part shapewear, part lingerie. Let us explain: The <strong>intricate mesh design inset</strong> and <strong>silky fabric</strong> elevated the look and feel of the panties, while its <strong>high-rise fit</strong> smoothed our silhouette for a flattering finish. And, the <strong>stretchy material </strong>is not only a huge plus for days we’re bloated but it feels <strong>extremely lightweight</strong> so we could hardly tell we were wearing underwear at all. Better yet, we can wear them during heavy flows because they performed as promised and absorbed three regular tampons worth of liquid.

However, the Eco Woman panties and their <strong>invisible stitching</strong> lay truly flat on our bodies and look hidden under body-skimming clothing — all while feeling dry<strong> holding four teaspoons of liquid</strong>.

Unlike some of the thick, claustrophobic, and bulky silhouettes we tried, Thinx designs these panties with <strong>breathable micromesh fabric </strong>perfect for hot days or workouts. Seriously, we could do cartwheels in these little panties. Despite its paper-weight design, the gusset extends high and wide enough that we felt pretty confident we could avoid spillage on a lighter day. Would we use them as a first line of defense when our flow is particularly heavy? Hard to say, but they’re a reliable backup option. Additionally, we love how the flat elastic seams don’t fold over, an aggravating pain point for any kind of underwear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Light | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–4XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-heavy-flows-knix-cotton-modal-super-absorbency-leakproof-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Heavy Flows</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix Cotton Modal Super Absorbency Leakproof Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix Cotton Modal Super Absorbency Leakproof Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NtXKaWaVghcOXLTzMevoFn3Yv8I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/knix-cotton-modal-super-leakproof-bikini-db8f738236fc4627806af7835c0fe516.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These undies held an impressive amount of fluid while still feeling flexible and comfy to wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The silhouette is a little bulky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Imagine a world where you never had to think about, look at, or touch a tampon again. Yeah, the Knix Cotton Leakproof Bikini brief is that good at keeping spillage in check. We doused these panties in eight brimming teaspoons of liquid and there wasn’t a leak in sight. Sure, it's not the most discreet option we tried (the gusset is pretty thick), but the bulkier fit is a tradeoff we’re more than happy to make in exchange for the peace of mind wearing these extremely absorbent underwear provides. Plus we found that the panties flexed with our movements rather than feeling stiff and immobile, and would be the perfect plus one for our workouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Heavy | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–4XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, spandex, polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-plus-sizes-tomboyx-first-line-leakproof-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Plus Sizes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TomboyX First Line Leakproof Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TomboyX First Line Leakproof Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gFbr5W6sWJ-uNeK3Ou4T5tSLVPo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/first-line-leakproof-bikini-28dba78c936345759177dde12262857e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TomboyX&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The company utilizes OEKO-TEX Certified materials that are free from toxins like PFOS or PFOA chemicals.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They weren’t as absorbent as we expected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the fashion industry still has room to improve, we’re finally seeing some movement in brands offering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plus-size underwear</a>, and thankfully this extends to period undies as well. TOMBOYX offers its sporty Leakproof Bikini panties in <strong>sizes up to 6XL</strong> and incorporates other thoughtful design details like a<strong> thick band</strong> that keeps the panties securely around our waist, particularly while we sleep, and a <strong>flexible gusset</strong>. Additionally, the brand only uses OEKO-TEX Certified materials<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span> that are guaranteed free from harmful cancer and infertility-causing chemicals, so we can feel better about our purchase. On the downside is the brand promised they’d hold up to eight teaspoons of liquid and they started to feel soaked after six, but depending on your flow this could still be enough coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Medium | <strong>Size:</strong> 3XS–6X | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-coverage-aisle-leakproof-boost-boxer-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full-Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aisle Leakproof BOOST Boxer Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aisle Leakproof BOOST Boxer Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MqOgw76fPV1888KPkOpVUqPh9_4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aisle-leakproof-boost-boxer-944878186f4b415993116b6c154b1fa4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aisle</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> There’s a pocket inside the gusset to place a pad.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The silhouette may not be discreet enough for everyday wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Frankly put, the Aisle Leakproof Boxer may not be on par with your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best lingerie</a> or sultry La Perla panties, but they get the job done and their <strong>full-coverage fit</strong> eases our anxieties around leakage. And what’s sexier than a calm mind? The fabric quickly absorbs up to eight teaspoons of liquid, around five regular tampons, and has extra space in the gusset to slip a pad into for further reinforcement, saving us from swapping out our tampon or pad in the middle of the day. Additionally, a <strong>thick waistband</strong> keeps the undies firmly in place no matter how much we move. That said, this style isn’t the most versatile option since its longer length and bulkier silhouette may peek out under shorter skirts or show beneath thinner fabrics, but they will be our go-to for lounging and sleeping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Absorbency:</strong> Heavy | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–5XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel, cotton, spandex, polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overnight-goat-union-overnight-period-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overnight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Goat Union Overnight Period Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Goat Union Overnight Period Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RUUn6Ih7jfcVBINItJpcZAqDNZk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/goat-union-overnight-shorts-3106bb3dc9794278a5f27ff5d04ef4a5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The high-rise fit stays put while we snooze and its full coverage design ensures zero leakage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We’ve tried softer options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even given our luxurious silk <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pillowcases</a>, we have a lot of roadblocks standing between us and a good night’s rest (doom-scrolling on TikTok for one) but finally, our period won’t be one of them.

In the same way that tampons and pads advertise whether they’re suitable for a light, medium, or heavy flow, period underwear offers similar guidelines and typically states how absorbent they are related to how many tampons-worth of liquid they hold. But, honestly, it may take some trial and error until you find the best fit for your flow, so if this is your first time free bleeding it’s not a bad idea to keep a tampon or pad on hand.</li><li><strong>Fit and Silhouette: </strong>Period underwear comes in the same styles and cut as our regular, everyday panties, so you have the option to choose the silhouette you’re most comfortable wearing, whether that’s an itty bitty thong or full-coverage briefs. Still, we recommend considering where you’ll be wearing them and what activities you’re performing. For instance, boxers are a great choice for sleeping, lounging, and working out because they provide the most coverage, but might look awkward and bulky under formal clothing. On the other hand, though their slimmer silhouettes make them more susceptible to spillage, bikini-cut panties, and thongs allow more freedom in the types of pants and skirts you wear with them.</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>When possible, it’s best to seek out organic and hypoallergenic materials free from toxic chemicals. “I recommend looking for certified labels, such as OEKO-TEX, which verifies that every fiber in the garment has been tested for harmful substances,” advises Dr. Grover. Additionally, Dr. LoGerfo says, “I always recommend consulting with a professional in the medical field when there are concerns about how your skin will interact with certain chemicals,” adding that because everyone’s skin is different, one person’s interaction will not be the same as someone else’s.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How does period underwear work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Period underwear should fit and feel <strong>like your everyday panties</strong>, except they’re <strong>equipped with extra layers of absorbent and moisture-wicking fabric to prevent leakage</strong>.
