Whether it’s your car, fitness tracker, or drug pump, the seamless functionality of these devices heavily relies upon the use of precise timing components working inside them.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>ECS</strong></a><strong> Inc. International</strong> is one of the leading companies of timing components, specializing in frequency control and power inductors. They manufacture high-level passive timing, frequency control, synchronization, connectivity, and magnetic power solutions used in various applications that power the modern world. Without these critical components, things such as telecommunications equipment, everyday utilities, navigation systems, and industrial processes would not work as intended.</p><p>As an international company, ECS Inc. has met the growing global demand with its innovative yet robust components by serving customers across more than 150 countries. With the delivery of its crystal oscillators, SMD crystals, power inductors, real-time clocks, and other products, they have remained one of the primary providers of frequency control solutions globally.</p><p><strong>Eric Slatten</strong> (President) is at the helm of ECS Inc. International. And we are excited to feature him in&nbsp;<strong>The Enterprise World’s</strong>&nbsp;current issue of&nbsp;<strong>The Most Successful Business Leaders to Watch Out for- 2023</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Embracing the Family Feeling</h2><p>Eric Slatten has been making leaps in the electronic component industry since 2008. He began his endeavors in inside sales and soon progressed toward leading the global sales department and becoming President last year. Outside of overseeing daily business operations, Eric fosters the corporate relationships between ECS Inc. and their OEMs, CMs and global distribution partners alongside the ECS Inc. regional sales managers and sales representative network. Presently at ECS, what once was a small family business has rapidly grown in just a short period, says Eric. Despite this quick expansion, the tight-knit family feeling remains a key feature of their culture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Growth Factors</h2><p>Eric Slatten firmly believes that one can reach key achievements every day. He can attribute the growth in his career and the company overall to those daily wins. Eric says that ECS Inc. International continues to pivot and adapt daily, and outpacing the market, which adds a level of one-of-a-kind contentment to every day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Veteran with astute Experience&nbsp;</h2><p>ECS Inc. International is a company with a vast experience of 43 years. Along with its innovative and reliable frequency control manufacturing, the company has a global presence with engineering and sales support systems in more than 18 countries, namely South Korea, Japan, China, Singapore, and the United States, catering to its customers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Triggering Point of Growth</h2><p>With decades of business experience and wisdom, ECS Inc. has grown in more ways than one. As ECS Inc. continues to grow, the relationships with current customers have reached new depths while also making way for new customers. According to Eric Slatten, a central part of the natural business growth cycle is hiring the right people for the right roles. However, only hiring them is not enough as you must let them do their job the best way without getting in their way.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Early Days</h2><p>Eric Slatten says he can’t comment on the early days of the company. However, in 1994, when his father purchased ECS Inc., the company was bringing in roughly $800,000 in revenue. In 2022, ECS did over $60,000,000, and they are well on their way to reaching $100,000,000. Reaching these milestones was made possible by everyone’s consistent work, sacrifice, and dedication, and all credit goes to the individuals who made it possible and the systems in place to help everyone succeed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Key Products & Services</h2><p>ECS Inc.
