class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Having faced a similar kind of scenario was British stand-up comedian Greg Davies who&nbsp;split with his wife-to-be.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Let's find out whether they are still clinging on to each other with anger in-between them, or they have already moved on? <span

star has had many rough days in his life, and the most recent one was in 2015, when news of his split with his longtime girlfriend started circulating. Davies was dating the Labour leadership contender and alleged wife, Liz Kendall, for many years.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Greg Davies's Alleged Wife-to-be Liz Kendall</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(source:&nbsp;dailymail.co.uk)</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The news about the couple’s split came weeks before the general election in May of 2015. In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mirror</a>, his alleged wife, Liz, said that the two had broken up but remained good friends with each other.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She further implied that she would not be the kind of politician who would mix up stuff about her private life and reveal it for everybody and like some space just for her. His alleged wife stated:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I am not going to be the sort of politician who does all that stuff about their private life. It’s very precious to me and really important I have that space that’s personal and just to me.”</p><p>On the other side, Greg has not spoken, nor has he given any statement regarding the splitting information that his alleged wife Liz outed. Although Liz says that she remains a good friend, Greg has not acknowledged anything. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Openly Gay Personality:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Adam Rippon Gay, Boyfriend, Parents, Net Worth</a></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Greg Davies Gay?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>There was a twist in the story with rumors of the comedian being gay after a fan tweeted a picture of Greg&nbsp;kissing another man in the show Taskmaster in August 2019. The picture of the host became viral overnight, and a lot of talks about his sexuality erupted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Moreover, rumors were circulating that Grey Davies might be having a romantic fling with fellow British comedian Alex Horne. Davies was well aware of the rumor&nbsp;and addressed it while talking to English comedian Russel Howard.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As per the YouTube <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> posted in 2020, Davies went through the rumor in Reddit and felt very unhappy.</p><p style=text-align:justify>That statement cleared it all; Davies is definitely not gay.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Greg's On-screen and Off-screen Loss</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In 2014, Greg went from other serious tragedies before the split when&nbsp;his on-screen father Rik Mayall passed away. The sad news did not stop after that as&nbsp;Greg lost his real-life father a couple of months later, he lost Rik. He said,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"My dad died a couple of months after Rik. It was a difficult year. It's a unique set of circumstances. It was incredibly sad. I was very close to my dad.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>It has already been over two years since Greg broke up with his partner/girlfriend?alleged wife-to-be; however, he has not been seen romantically linked with anyone else. Having broken up with a woman has indeed crushed any speculation regarding his gay rumors. Now, the only wait is for him to get married as people don’t get any younger, but in Greg's case, he still carries the charm and continues his work in Man Down and Cuckoo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Professional Player:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Kelley O'Hara Married, Dating, Girlfriend, Lesbian</a></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Davies's Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Davies is going through the highest of his career&nbsp;with&nbsp;projects like&nbsp;Taskmaster,&nbsp;8 Out of 10 Cats,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Netflix comedy special&nbsp;You Magnificent Beast.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Moreover, he has had a number of TV shows under his belt, which include Saxondal, The Wall, The Inbetweeners, We Are Klang, Ask Rhod Gilbert, Fast and Loose, Cuckoo, Man Down, This Is Jinsy, AGert Lush Christmas, Travel Man, Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods and many others.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>From the grand success of his shows, his net worth has propelled to $5 million, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Apart from that, the giant of a man is also going places with his comedy shows and making a sold-out crowd every time.
