The following details will come in handy.</p><h3>Maria's early life and education</h3><p class=align-left>The renowned TV and film actress' date of birth is 18th April, 1967. She was born in Pennsylvania. Her mother is known as Kathy while her father is named Joe Bello. She attended Villanova University with the intention of majoring in Political Science but did not wait to become a lawyer as was earlier intended.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, she developed an interest in the arts after she began taking acting classes during her senior years. What started slowly grew into a passion that would lead her into her current career. After graduating from college, Bello decided to work on honing her skills by taking up several New York theatre productions. Little did she know that she would grow to be an excellent actress.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/792c703be21a0834.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bella Dayne bio: family, net worth, measurements, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Anna Torv measurements, husband, children and hot photos</p><h3>Career progression</h3><p class=align-left>You may know a lot about Maria Bello movies and TV shows, but what you may not be farmiliar with is the fact that she was not always a big shot. She debuted as an actress when she took part in small off-broad-way plays such as “Small Town Gals with Big Problems”, “The Killer Inside Me”, and “Urban Planning”. Her first TV appearance was on a number of TV shows such as; Due South (1994), The Commish (1991), Misery Loves Company (1995), and Nowhere Man (1995). Her big breakthrough in TV happened when she got cast as part of the Mr. & Mrs. Smith show. She was the Mrs. Smith of the TV series.</p><p class=align-left>It is unfortunate that only after 8 weeks of existence, the show was cancelled. The good news though is that Maria got an ER role in an American medical drama TV series that was created by the novelist and medical doctor, Mr. Michael Crichton. This show aired on NBC from September 19, 1994, to April 2, 2009. It mainly revolved around the happenings and life of staff and workers in the emergency room (ER) of a fictional County General Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. A number of critical things happened to the physicians as well as the staff that used the room. Maria became a guest-star in the show where she acted as Dr. Anna Del Amico.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6bea3641a8554573.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Delta Burke: Gerald McRaney relationship, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/36fd28c9d82887dc.jpg><p class=align-left>Being a major success in the show, and because of Maria's impressive work, she was able to draw a lot of attention leading to the debut of Bello's movie in 1998 known as ‘Permanent Midnight’. This was followed by other successive movies such as “Coyote Ugly”, and “The Cooler”, which bagged her several nominations and awards. In an another film; “A History of Violence”, Bello portrayed the character of a wife under siege from her husband's past. This movie fetched her a New York Film Critics Circle award and a Golden Globe nomination. In 2009, Bello played the part of the mother of a girl struggling to discover her lost self in the film; “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee”.</p><p class=align-left>Her ongoing drive for success wasn't halt at this stage.

As I continued to look through photos, I came across a black-and-white one of my best friend and me taken on New Year's Eve.
