The couples were dating each other until River Phoenix died on October 31st, 1993. The same year they met, and she was with him that night.

In the book released in 2013, “Last Night At The Viper Room” it was claimed that the ambulance was called on time, Phoenix could have been saved, but instead, his younger brother guided him out the club saying everything was under control until Phoenix got into a seizure and fell on the ground. The book described Phoenix’s friends and brother as ‘young, scared, and they didn’t know what to do.’</p><p>The sight made Christina Applegate break down in tears as she came out of the Viper Room and Samantha while watching her boyfriend suffer broke down as she was hopeless. His younger sister Rain tried to stop the seizure by sitting on Phoenix’s chest after which Joaquin called the 911 and begged for help saying,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>&nbsp;‘Please come, he’s dying, please.'&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Phoenix was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and later he was declared dead at 1:51 am.
