I joked about going full pirate mode with a peg leg but knew it could be a reality and was very sad about it. Somehow, they saved it.

Or, do we hide in the shadows, being afraid of what might happen if we are so bold to follow our dreams?'</span></p><p><span>McNeely’s expecting another two weeks in the hospital if all goes well, and then a further six to nine months before he can walk again.
