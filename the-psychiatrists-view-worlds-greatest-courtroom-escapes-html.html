impulses behind the world's greatest-ever court escapes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Impulsiveness, opportunism, and cold hard calculations all contribute to the split-second decisions made by those who make daring attempts to break out of court.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Forensic psychiatrist Dr Sohom Das' work sees him psychoanalyse criminals as they make their way through criminal justice systems around the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The expert doctor cut his teeth working in the UK's courts, prison, and secure psychiatric units - including the infamous Broadmoor Hospital which houses some of Britain's most notorious criminals.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His career sees him work with murderers, rapists, thieves, and arsonists, in acting as an expert witness in court and helping to treat and rehabilitate dangerous and violent offenders.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, Das has offered his insights into those who seek to avoid serving time by making a break for it - and the psychological impulses that drive them to do it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as background factors, such as poverty and growing up in criminality, elements of an individual's character, such as a lack of empathy, can lead to them seeking a big break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>But in some cases it is simply an impulsive and risk-taking nature that seeks them break free.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Here, MailOnline explores some of the

class=mol-para-with-font>The handcuffed criminal, then aged 24, made a daring escape that saw him evade an armed guard while his back was turned.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A video shows him

making a dash out of the courthouse before simply fleeing out of the courthouse doors after being convicted of possessing methamphetamine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Police tracked Mr Hyde II to an apartment block just three miles away before sending him back to jail less than two hours later.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Afterwards, the court reviewed its security measures and concluded Hyde had managed to escape through a 'blind spot'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In his analysis Dr Sohom Das said: 'I think actually some criminals are quite impulsive and they're risk takers as well.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think that's relevant because that's what we're seeing here with these people that are trying to get out of court.

If somebody's on a fairly small charge, it's not really worth it because you could get caught and you could serve more jail time as opposed to someone who's on a murder charge.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Plus another element would be how likely it is that they can evade the police in the long term.
