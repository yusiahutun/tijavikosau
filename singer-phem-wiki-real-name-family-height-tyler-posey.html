Not for everyone, but some do make an everlasting memory on this special day. Singer Phem was definitely one of the luckiest who will forever remember Feb 14, 2023, as it was the day Tyler Posey asked her to marry him.</span></p><p><span>This Singer Phem Wiki explores more of her life.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Singer Phem, Tyler Posey Girlfriend-Turned-Fiancee</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem and Tyler Posey started their relationship in 2020 after music producer John Feldmann asked the former to write some music with the actor. “We bonded about singing about our exes,” Tyler recalled.</span></p><p><span>However, Phem wasn’t looking for romance then. “I went into it strictly business… I swear,” she shared. But Tyler’s charm was irresistible. The singer quickly fell in love with him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After two years of dating, the duo got engaged on Valentine’s Day 2023 in Cambria, California — Phem’s favorite place. It was just the two of them taking a romantic stroll on the beach as Tyler popped the question with a green ring.&nbsp; “I should’ve known when he propped his phone up on a rock to film that something was up… but I had no idea,” Phem said.</span></p><p><span>The couple was scheduled to exchange vows in October 2023. Though they didn’t reveal the location, “We’re keeping it close to home and getting married at a very special place that means a lot to us,” said Tyler. Also, the </span><i><span>Teen Wolf</span></i><span> star said that it was going to be a “fairly intimate wedding, ” but the reception will be the dance party everyone can join.</span></p><p><span>“Tyler and I are both very spiritually open people so it means a lot we are able to have the service at such a peaceful place,” Phem chimed in.</span></p><p><span>Now that the two are engaged, Tyler feels “deeper and just more confident and settled in.”</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Phem said her fiancee just got “10x hotter all of a sudden.” But humor apart, she does appreciate him as a person who understands her on a soul level. “From the jump, he validated my queerness even though I’m now with him and that was really important to me. He strives to be a better person every day and I am so proud of his sobriety and commitment to self-growth,” she shared.</span></p><p><span>In fact, it was Phem who helped the actor explore his sexuality. She’s helped me realize that I fit under the queer umbrella and that I’m sexually fluid,” he explained.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Phem has been with both men and women. Thus her pronouns (she/her and they/them) are interchangeable.</span></p><h3><b>Singer Phem Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem garnered a net worth of above $500 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>The indie music artist, Phem rose to the spotlight through off-kilter pop features and singles within the more electronic-centric world and later built a discography through collaborators that would enlist her to balance out the heaviness of shattering synth drops and thick-cut 808s. Thereafter, she traded out features with predominately LA-based dance music producers for musicians like G-Eazy and Machine Gun Kelly, those that more accurately reflected her changing tastes.</span></p><p><span>Now, Phem’s touring the world and living her dream. Only recently, in April 2023, she and her band played at several shows for Avril Lavigne‘s Love Sux tour.</span></p><p><span>Some of her most popular songs are Not Without My Ghosts, Sorry Mama, Flowers, Watery, Silly Putty, Dead Yet, Shut UP, and Girls. Find more of them on her Youtube @</span><a href=#><span>phem4evr149</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Phem grew up playing the drums and listening to Flying Lotus who later became her friend and mentor.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Singer Phem Age</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem was 33 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She is two years older than her fiance Tyler.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Singer Phem Real Name?</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem’s real name is Olivia (Liv) Marsico.</span></p><p><span>She picked her alias “Phem” picked because it’s “cool and cute”, and also because it represents the fact she has always been the ‘fem’ in relationships with women.</span></p><h3><b>Singer Phem Family</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem has her family to thank for the gift of music. “Both my parents are musicians, so I was lucky enough to be born into a household where music was constantly around,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Frank Marsic was one of the best jazz percussionists in Los Angeles. He was a member of </span><i><span>The Martini Kings </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Baja Marimba Mania</span></i><span>. Besides drums, he also played marimba, keyboards, and harmonica.</span></p><p><span>Frank turned 71 on May 26, 2022.</span></p><p><span>As for Phem’s mother, Marie Marsico @</span><a href=#><span>marie.marsico</span></a><span> is a classical piano player. It was she who first asked Phem to start playing the piano.</span></p><p><span>Marie turned 72 in April 2023.</span></p><p><span>Besides them, Phem’s 3-year-older brother Miles Marsico is also into music. But he is more of an actor. You might have seen him as “Jason” in </span><i><span>Jason and the Heroes of Mount Olympus </span></i><span>(2002) or heard his voice in </span><i><span>Lloyd in Space</span></i><span> (2001 – 2004).</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Phem’s mother was unsupportive of her sexuality. She cried for a year saying, “No this is not you, you gotta think about this…” Now, Phem writes about her relationship with her parents in her music.</span></p><h3><b>Singer Phem Height</b></h3><p><span>Singer Phem stands tall at a height of around 5 feet 1 inch.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Singer Phem Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Phem receives her birthday wishes on June 1.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Singer Phem From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Phem hails from Los Angeles, CA.
