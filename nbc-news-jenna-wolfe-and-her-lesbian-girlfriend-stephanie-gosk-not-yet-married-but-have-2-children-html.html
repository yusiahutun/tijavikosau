"After all, I was never the kid that ran around playing house.

Currently working as an NBC News correspondent, Jenna is an acclaimed and self-inspired personality.</p><h2>Jenna Wolfe&nbsp;Demoted for being Pregnant?</h2><p>Jenna Wolfe was once NBC's star on the weekend edition of 'The Today Show' alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Lester Holt</a>. The two meshed quite well and seemed like good partners and friends; however, when Jenna was abruptly replaced by <a href=# rel=follow>Erica Hill</a>.</p><p><strong>You might like:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Ron Stallworth and His Wife- An Old Love Story that Rekindled</a></strong></p><p>The change was not welcomed that well, and many questioned NBC's decision and wondered why Jenna was demoted. However, fellow Journalist Rick Sanchez raised some intriguing questions everyone meant to ask.</p><p><img alt="Rick Sanchez has an intriguing question" height=211 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/jenna%20rick%20sanchez.png width=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Caption: Rick Sanchez has an intriguing question (source: mediaite.com)</strong></p><p>Speculation was made that Jenna had&nbsp;to choose between her job and her child, and she chose the latter. Of course, Rick had no backing for this assumption, and when it was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that the truth was far different, his ideas were pushed back even more.</p><p>According to sources, there's no animosity between Erica, Wolfe, and NBC; the demotion is a complete logical course of action. It was reported that NBC had been trying to get a hold of Erica for quite some time and when she agreed to work on 'The Today Show,' Wolfe had to make space. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was further reported that Jenna only reported her pregnancy after the demotion, and Erica herself provided advice and suggestions to Jenna regarding childbirth and pregnancy. Seems it's all in the books now, and it's all fair and good.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Jenna did <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leave</a> 'The Today Show' about a year later when she took on the role of the Online correspondent for lifestyle and fitness for NBC news. This eventually led her to create her current identity of the fitness advocating Jenna we know of. Great to know it turned out quite fine!</p><h2>More on Jenna Wolfe's</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Wolfe was born on February 16, 1974, in Kingston, Jamaica, and&nbsp;currently ages 48 years old.
