as a result of years of cocaine abuse.<br></span></p><p><span>Immediately after the death, it was widely thought that drinking binges combined with prescription pills combined to make the star lose consciousness and slip under the bathwater.<br></span></p><p><span>But the toxicology tests did not show any significant amount of alcohol in Ms. Houstonâs system.<br></span></p><p><span>Several bottles of prescription medication were found in her hotel room, but they were not said to be in excessive quantities.
