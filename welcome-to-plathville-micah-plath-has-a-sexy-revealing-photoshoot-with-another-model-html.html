href=#>Welcome to Plathville</a> moved in with his 17-year-old sister, fellow rebel <a href=#>Moriah Plath</a>. On his own for the first time ever, the homeschooled teen began to explore new things in life – like social media, dating, and even professional modeling.</p><p id=par-2_42>On the Nov. 17 episode of <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville season 2</a>, Micah took yet another step away from his parents’ conservative lifestyle. He posed for a revealing, intimate photoshoot in a hotel room with a female model, who gushed about their “chemistry.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>Micah opened up about why it was important to him to change the way he dressed</h2><p id=par-3_24>Before meeting up with his friend and former modeling partner, Helena, Micah explained why modeling represented such a big step toward independence for him.</p><p id=par-4_54>Growing up, Micah explained, the 19-year-old expected to farm for the rest of his life. He wasn’t allowed to participate in pop culture or the modern world – especially things like connecting with others on social media or dreaming of travel. Micah’s modeling career allowed him to express himself in a new, creative way.</p><p id=par-5_18>What’s more, Micah had often been taught to hide his body and even to feel ashamed of it.</p><p id=par-6_40>“Growing up, we had a lot of clothing restrictions,” the <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville</a> star shared. “When we went to the beach, we had to wear long pants and t-shirts…My parents find it immodest to show your body to the world.”</p><p id=par-7_55>That’s why moving into a career in which he felt confident to show off his physical progress and own his sexuality and attractiveness was such a big deal for Micah. He enjoyed the chance to develop his personal style and even get interested in fashion, which had never seemed like an option in the past.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The ‘Welcome to Plathville’ star said modeling had helped him figure out his identity</h2><p id=par-8_35>Micah went on to explain that networking on social media to build his career, as well as getting validation about his looks from women, had helped him build a better body image and more self-esteem.</p><p id=par-9_46>“When I was 13 or 14, I was in the ugly duckling stage,” the Welcome to Plathville star lamented. “I’ve always been very self-conscious of my looks and shy around girls – just a shy little kid. And then I started to grow out of that.”</p><p id=par-10_30>But now, Micah marveled at just how different his life looked. Even a year beforehand, he couldn’t have imagined taking shirtless photos up close and personal with a female model.</p><p id=par-11_41>“You look at where I’m at now, in a hotel room with a super hot girl about to get some steamy photos taken?” Micah laughed. “It’s like a 180. But to me, I think it’s a 180 in a positive direction.”</p><p id=par-12_46>Despite the fact that the teen knew his parents, <a href=#>Kim and Barry Plath</a>, wouldn’t approve of his new venture, he didn’t feel it was a “rebellion” against them. Instead, the Welcome to Plathville star argued, it was all about pushing his own boundaries and finding himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Helena and Micah flirted with each other during their photoshoot</h2><p id=par-13_41>Helena and Micah’s photo shoot quickly went from flirty to downright risqué. Micah wore a suit jacket and pants with no shirt underneath, while his fellow model donned a crop top before changing into a leotard and posing on the bed.</p><p id=par-14_38>Micah explained that Helena was actually the first woman he ever modeled with – but at first, he was too afraid even to touch her, much less to get intimate with her for a photo shoot like this.</p><p id=par-15_21>As for Helena, she made no bones about the fact that she was very attracted to the “new and improved” Micah.</p><p id=par-16_30>“I like this Micah,” she gushed, comparing him to the “shy” version she’d met a year earlier. “I like this confident, sexy man. You’re a man now; you own it.”</p><p id=par-17_37>“I’m very proud of him for taking control and being as confident as he was,” Helena told Welcome to Plathville producers. “It was actually very attractive. There’s definitely chemistry there. I mean, it’s hard to deny it.”</p><p id=par-18_39>The shoot ended with some snapshots that certainly wouldn’t have pleased Micah’s parents. The <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville star</a> lathered up in the shower wearing just boxer briefs – and he didn’t seem self-conscious at all, to say the least.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEprjCqKSeZaSkerG4wK2fr6GcobJuucicmKFloKGutbSMoZisZZFiwKbE2Gapnq6VlrmqusZmp6GnpKTAqbvOrWSwoaSdeqK6zq2fnqpdorylsctnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./charles-farrell-actor.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Charles Farrell dating?
