the quickest way to get around the five square-kilometre island - to explore. The relatively unmarked roads, however, do offer a bit of a navigation challenge. Still, you probably don't want to walk up to the island's famed lookout point, One Tree Hill, on foot. Nevertheless, there's no better place to enjoy a glass of prosecco at sunset.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There's also a bustling marina, as well as a main street with shops, restaurants and even a nightclub. Here you can buy everything from sun cream to iced coffee, but beware: items that have been brought on to Hamilton do cost more than they would on the mainland. (So stock up on aloe vera before you arrive.)</span></p><img id=i-cf1a7af9317583c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/07/09/2FE00F9000000578-3345751-image-a-24_1452160621952.jpg height=641 width=962 alt="Another accommodation option is the adults-only Beach Club, which as its name suggests, is ideally located just steps from the beach" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Another accommodation option is the adults-only Beach Club, which as its name suggests, is ideally located just steps from the beach</p><img id=i-d226b2e4e3782139 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/07/09/2FE00E7E00000578-3345751-image-a-25_1452160628152.jpg height=641 width=962 alt="At Beach Club, there is also a private child-free infinity pool, as well as specialised - and very secluded - dining options&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>At Beach Club, there is also a private child-free infinity pool, as well as specialised - and very secluded - dining options&nbsp;</p><img id=i-84762728243896b3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/04/10/2F0D531600000578-3345751-image-a-72_1449225531505.jpg height=641 width=962 alt="Hamilton Island Golf Club is one of the world's most spectacular courses - after all, where else can you get a view like that from the tee?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Hamilton Island Golf Club is one of the world's most spectacular courses - after all, where else can you get a view like that from the tee?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Our afternoon was spent on a chartered <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Sunsail</a> yacht to a private beach - not the famed Whitehaven, unfortunately, due to lack of time.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It didn't really matter though as the inlet, which we ultimately reached by dinghy, was completely secluded.
