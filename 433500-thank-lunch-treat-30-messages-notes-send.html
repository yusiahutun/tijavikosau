You can respond by sending a "thank you for the lunch treat" note to thank them for the meal. Remember, the thank you for lunch message should be sent within 72 hours of its receipt if possible. A thank-you note sent late, however, is always better than not sending one at all.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb5b2be2bea8efda.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ appreciation messages for all events</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>published a list of <a href=#>thank you teacher </a>messages from parents to show appreciation. Teachers play a critical role in shaping the future of children as they educate and shape their character to conform to societal expectations.

Sometimes a simple thank you is enough to raise the morale of teachers. A thank you note to a teacher from a parent should indicate the reason for the congratulation and what it means to the parent.
