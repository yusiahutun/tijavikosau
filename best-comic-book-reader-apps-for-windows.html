If you're a comics fan using Windows 10, you may not know what options are out there for a decent, dedicated comic reader.</p><p>Whether it's work from IDW, Marvel, or an indie-comics label, the software in this list represents your best choices for reading comics on your Windows 10 machines.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=cover>1. Cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cover.jpg><p>One of the best options available on the market right now is Cover. The Windows-10-native app can be downloaded for free from the Microsoft Store and has a whole bunch of useful features.</p><p>You can sync your own files, so you don't need to purchase your books via in-app purchases such as subscriptions. If you already have a large library of CBR or CBZ files, then Cover is perfect for you, as it comes with a built-in library manager.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Get Cover Comic Reader From the Microsoft Store</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The app does have its limitations. You're locked into only carrying 25 books at a time unless you unlock the app through a one-off in-app purchase. The purchase is pretty cheap (around $2) but you should be aware of that before you take the plunge and get the app yourself.</p><p>On the plus side, if you do decide to shell out for the full version of the reader, the app will also synchronize your collection over the cloud. So if you happen to run Windows 10 on both your tablet and PC, you'll have access to your comics on both platforms.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cover</a> (Free, premium version available)</p><h2 id=cdisplay-ex>2. CDisplay Ex</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CDisplay-Ex.jpg><p>While nowhere near as good-looking as Cover, CDisplay Ex is an amazing free option for folks who like to read slightly older comics. CDisplay Ex bills itself as the world's most popular comics reader, and it's easy to see why.</p><p>The program allows you to read comics in almost any format you might expect to find a comic saved in. Image files, PDF documents, and of course classic CBR or CBZ files will all work with this reader.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There's also the extra-special feature of automatic color correction in case you're reading some old comic scans that haven't aged so well. This color correction feature is not only impressive but genuinely useful since harder comics with color issues can be a pain to read.</p><p>The only thing that knocks CDisplay Ex down a peg or two as a comic reader is that it completely lacks any sort of library function. If you want to organize your comics outside of your standard filesystem, CDisplay Ex leaves you high-and-dry.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>On the plus side, it does at least come with a plugin that adds each comic's cover as a proper thumbnail. So now when you're browsing through your comic folders, you'll actually be able to identify them visually, than via the title alone.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CDisplay Ex</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=comicrack>3. ComicRack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ComicRack.jpg><p>ComicRack is a pretty popular option when it comes to reading comics on Windows 10, but it's missing out on a few key features over a lot of other readers on the market.</p><p>For a start, it can't handle image files. So, if you happen to have a bunch of Sunday comic strips saved directly from scans, you'll have to convert them to CBR or CBZ files before you can actually read them.</p><p>There's also no slick-looking library and no automatic sorting of books into their own series folders. You do have a library, but it easily becomes overwhelmed if you happen to have a lot of comics in your collection.</p><p>Fortunately, ComicRack does have some advantages that make it a worthy choice for the right sort of person. It's one of the only comic readers available that allows you to read more than one comic at a time, with each in its own tab. So if you want to compare two editions for some reason, ComicRack makes it much easier.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can edit each comics' meta info while you're reading it, so it's possible to micromanage your entire collection. There's also a magnifier in case you want to see the details of the artwork up close.</p><p>The last useful tidbit is that ComicRack is compatible with tablet controls. So you can drag up and down to read the comic if you use a touchscreen. You can even <a href=#>use it to organize your comic collection on Android</a> as well.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=#>ComicRack</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=mcomix>4. MComix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mcomix.jpg><p>MComix is another great comic reader for Windows 10 but loses out on both features and usability when compared with some of the other entries on this list.</p><p>You can still make a library and read comics in many different formats, but the app feels unintuitive to use. The library isn't integrated into the app, but it opens in a separate window, and although you can read image files, you can't add them to your library for some reason.</p><p>If you only have a few comics, then MComix will fulfill your needs perfectly, as opening individual files and reading them is a pretty simple experience. It's even pretty easy to read an entire series, as when you open a single file, it automatically loads the next file in the folder when you're done reading.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If MComix has one advantage it's that the app is completely portable, so you don't even need to install it. You can just put it onto a memory stick or SD card and carry it around with you if you use a lot of random computers and want to always have access to your comic library.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=#>MComix</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=mangameeya>5. MangaMeeya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MangaMeehen.jpg><p>The final entry on our list is MangaMeeya, a freeware application that is designed for reading Japanese comics known as manga. Despite being designed for a right-to-left reading system, MangaMeeya is perfect for reading comics.</p><p>Much like MComix, MangaMeeya is portable and freeware, so you can take it with you anywhere. Unlike MComix, you won't be able to use it from the get-go without changing some settings unless you're reading manga. This is a bit of a setback compared to other apps, as most feature an on-screen toggle between manga mode and comic mode. MangaMeeya requires you to go through the options menu to change between the two.</p><p>MM is also missing any library function at all, so you have to manage your library on your own. On the plus side, the small file size and portability make it perfect for a smaller hard drive, such as those on a tablet or laptop. Although the software is no longer being updated by the original creators, many on GitHub have taken the code and kept adding to it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you do happen to be in the market for manga, you can use <a href=#>our guide of the best sites to read manga for free legally</a>.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=#>MangaMeeya</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=enjoy-comics-on-your-windows-pc>Enjoy Comics on Your Windows PC</h2><p>You should now be well armed to get your comic collection organized and readable on your Windows 10 device.
