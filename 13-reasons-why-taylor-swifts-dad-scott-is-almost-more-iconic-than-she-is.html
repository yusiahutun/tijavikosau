But the sweet and adorable things he does as the star’s father makes him a fan-favorite with Swifties.</strong></p><p>The two people who created a <a href=#>celebrity</a> who has somehow peaked into becoming the ‘most famous woman on the planet’ are highly-respected within the Swiftie kingdom. That’ll be Taylor’s parents – Scott and <a href=#>Andrea Swift</a>. Their own love story began in Houston, Texas, and they probably never imagined where their life would lead three decades later. To celebrate Scott Swift’s birthday, we’ve found 13 reasons Taylor’s dad is adorable, iconic, and sweet – because it’s her favorite number, of course.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-reasons-swifties-love-taylor-swift-s-dad-scott>13 reasons Swifties love Taylor Swift’s dad Scott</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-ran-a-christmas-tree-farm-like-he-was-in-a-real-life-hallmark-movie>He ran a Christmas Tree farm like he was in a real-life Hallmark movie</h3><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> really did grow up on a <a href=#>Christmas Tree farm</a> – and it can’t get more festive than that. Her parents moved to Pennseylvania after they tied the knot for their Pine Ridge Farm.</p><p>The music star spend her first years at the ranch, and we suspect Hallmark grew inspired by their story for almost all of their films. Who wouldn’t?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scott-and-andrew-moved-the-entire-family-for-taylor-s-dream>Scott and Andrew moved the entire family for Taylor’s dream</h3><p>The celebrity had big dreams. When she was 14, she had the aspiration to become a singer and songwriter, and after she signed a deal with Sony/ATV Publishing, they believed in her too.</p><p>They uprooted the family, which included her younger brother Austin, to a suburb 20 miles from Nashville.</p><p>But, her parents had a strong sense about it when they did so.</p><p>Andrea told Entertainment Weekly in 2008: “I never wanted to make that move about her ‘making it’.</p><p>“Because what a horrible thing if it hadn’t happened, for her to carry that kind of guilt or pressure around. And we moved far enough outside Nashville to where she didn’t have to be going to school with producers’ kids and label presidents’ kids and be reminded constantly that she was struggling to make it. We’ve always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true.”</p><p>However, the now 34-year-old, did know it was the main reason.</p><p>She knew they were trying to make her feel better. Taylor told E!: “But they tried to put no pressure on me. They were like, ‘Well, we need a change of scenery anyway’ and ‘I love how friendly the people in Tennessee are.’”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-used-his-business-skills-to-help-her>He used his business skills to help her</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1862771986-1024x683.jpg><p>Her parents, who had a background of finance, backed her before she even signed the <a href=#>music</a> deal – she was the youngest to sign at the record company FYI.</p><p>Taylor’s dad Scott Swift worked as a stockbroker and was vice president for Merrill Lynch. Her mom was a marketing manager at an advertising agency. They used their skills to help her get seen.</p><p>They already set up her Myspace, and her website was up and running before she had a proper manager.</p><p>Rick Barker, Taylor’s manager, said: “The mom and dad both have great marketing minds. I don’t want to say fake it until you make it, but when you looked at her stuff, it was very professional even before she got her deal.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-guitar-picks-on-hand-at-all-times>Guitar picks on hand at all times</h3><p>Scott loves Taylor’s fans as much as she does. It’s pretty clear.</p><p>He’s known to give out an unlimited amount of guitar picks to the crowd at her concerts. He also gives them out to other stars too, handing one out to Travis Kelce as well as <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a>‘s brother Finneas.</p><p>Finneas spoke about it during a live stream once. He said: “These are my Taylor Swift ‘Lover’ guitar picks.</p><p>“Taylor Swift’s dad [Scott] gave them to me backstage one time. He was an incredibly nice man.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-re-a-small-family-business>They’re a ‘small family business’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-83508760-811x1024.jpg><p>In a cute post in March last year, Taylor shared a photo of her dad’s DIY all-access pass she made for him.</p><p>Despite her being 33 years old at the time, it was an adorable moment for sure.</p><p>She had crafted a pass that had the words: “DOH pass (Dad of Headliner) all Access).”</p><p>She then captioned over the post: “Made my dad’s tour credential. We are a small family business”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-doesn-t-mind-travis-missed-his-high-five>He doesn’t mind Travis missed his high-five</h3><p>When Travis flew down to Argentina to support Taylor last year, it was the iconic moment she changed the lyrics for the tight end. Instead of singing, ‘Karma is the guy on the screen’, she sang, ‘<a href=#>Karma is the guy on the Chiefs</a>‘. Of course the Eras Tour crowd went wild, and Travis was in awe.</p><p>Travis Kelce explained on his <a href=#>New Heights podcast</a>, he does with brother Jason, he didn’t realize Scott went in for a high-five.</p><p><a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> asked Trav how he felt about Tay-Tay changing the lyrics.</p><p>He said: “I had no clue, well I might have had a little bit of a clue. Definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth [it] still shocked me. I was like, ‘Oh s**t. She really just said that.’”</p><p>But his big brother said he was shocked he left Taylor Swift’s dad hanging.</p><p>“Scott’s over here looking for a high-five,” Jason explained.</p><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> responded: “Year, Mr. Swift, I apologize big guy.”</p><p>“Aw man, I missed that. I never miss a high-five, too. Big high-five guy. It’s the most electric thing you can do at an event, and so, sorry Mr. Swift,” Travis added.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scott-swift-listened-when-taylor-wanted-to-speak-her-mind>Scott Swift listened when Taylor wanted to speak her mind</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Scott sat down with Taylor after she made comments to support former Tennessee Gov Phil Bredesen in his bid for a Senate sit against Marsha Blackburn.</p><p>Her mom Andrea was also sitting next to her, and appeared to support Taylor wanting to come out and officially support a candidate. However, Taylor Swift’s dad Scott was apprehensive. Not because he didn’t agree with his daughter, but he feared for her life.</p><p>He even admitted in the clip he had purchased armoured cars to protect her life.</p><p>Fans agreed. One said: “I also feel it should be noted her father wasn’t speaking against what she stands for. He was speaking out of fear for his daughters safety and for that I can’t blame him.”</p><p>A second added: “I understand what her dads perspective is. Her daughters safety is his number 1 priority! I think in that moment he is proud and scared at the same time.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-handed-out-pizzas-to-waiting-fans>He handed out pizzas to waiting fans</h3><p>In 2019, when she was set to appear on Good Morning America, dedicated Swifties camped out overnight in a bid to see her the next day. Taylor ordered pizzas to be delivered so they would stay warm and hungry and they were handed out by her team, including her dad Scott Swift.</p><p>She was set to perform live in Central Park and the fans had lined up to not miss a spot.</p><p>Fans were also happy over Papa Swift’s appearance, some took selfies with him.</p><p>Spot him giving out guitar picks again, eh?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-pulled-such-a-dad-move-in-the-vip-suite>He pulled such a dad move in the VIP suite</h3><p>Days after Taylor celebrated her 34th birthday on December 13, Swift and her dad Scott went to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce play the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.</p><p>It was a nice way to round off her birthday week, and seemingly they had brought up birthday cake to celebrate again.</p><p>But one <a href=#>TikTok</a> user shared a clip of Scott coming into their suite to share some of her cake with them too.</p><p>We see him turn around to Taylor in the suite next door who smiles and crinkles her nose.</p><p>Such a dad move.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-still-gives-out-food-even-now>He still gives out food even now</h3><p>Scott really knows how the stomach can be the key to most people’s hearts. Last week, he was filmed being the <a href=#>real MVP of the Eras Tour</a> in Sydney when he gave out sandwiches to fans in the crowd of Accor Stadium.</p><p>The wholesome encounter saw the 71-year-old dish out a tray of food to hungry Swifties who swarmed like flies.</p><p>He even held a lamp over the platter so everyone could see what they’re grabbing.</p><p>One fan joked: “I love the idea that Taylor see these while scrolling in bed and is just like ‘dads being a dad’.”</p><p>Yep, bet she does.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-rides-a-segway-backstage>He rides a Segway backstage</h3><p>This is just cool, because we’d just be falling off.</p><p>Last summer the star shared a clip of her dad following her golf caddy on his Segway. He didn’t seem to mind he wasn’t included on the cart at all, enjoying the ride.</p><p>Taylor Swift then pans the camera onto her face as she laughs at her dad Scott.</p><p>Fans loved the behind-the-scenes clip.</p><p>She also used the song, Ridin’ Dirty in the background. So fitting.</p><p>“Getaway Car (segway version),” one fan quipped as others thought it was a hidden message because she loves using Easter eggs. But we think this time, it was just a funny video.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-dad-scott-delivered-handwritten-letter>Taylor Swift’s dad Scott delivered handwritten letter</h3><p>Last month it was revealed Scott Swift delivered a handwritten not from the singer, as they were invited personally by Taylor to enter her VIP tent at her Melbourne show.</p><p>YouTube stars, Emily Hunt and Bonny Rebecca, run a popular channel themed around the singer, Chats and Reacts. It seems Taylor knows their videos All Too Well as she let them in at the VIP area.</p><p>“Scott, thank you soooo much for being so kind and generous!! And Taylor, we cannot believe you took the time to write us letters thank you so much, we have never been so grateful and elated in all our lives,” the duo wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dad-scott-swift-is-a-real-swiftie-he-loves-taylor-s-music>Dad Scott Swift is a real Swiftie – he loves Taylor’s music</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Taylor said one of her favorite moments is to play her new <a href=#>music</a> to her dad, and how he doesn’t care who is around when he gets to hear it the first time.</p><p>In a clue clip, we see Taylor give her dad some of her new tracks. He’s seen bopping around, moving his head and hands to the beat. Scott even sings along, and we don’t think there’s a bigger Swiftie.</p><p>He tells her: “This is good stuff, this is great. Oh my god, this is amazing, I can’t stop listening to this stuff.</p><p>“Unbelievable. Sorry I’m going back into my zone,” he adds before putting the headphones back on.</p><p>So cute.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WCcH2SZqmemaOku7R51qGwZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepKh6pa3DZqqcp6Speqq%2FjJqjpqejqXquu9GeZKKbn6O2pHnToZinZaOdsm610mg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./3d-modeling-on-pc-vs-tablet.html>&#171;&nbsp;3D Modeling on Your PC vs. Your Tablet: Which Is Better?</a>
