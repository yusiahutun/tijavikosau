Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, and as fate would have it, these included the two seats closest to the blown-out hole.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The oxygen masks dropped immediately, and Bartlett saw a flight attendant walking down the aisle toward the affected row, leaning forward as if facing a stiff wind. Then flight attendants began moving passengers from the area where the blowout occurred and helped them move away.</p><figure id=ce83a2ac-30f8-4fa1-9957-59ddbb34d5c6 data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The recovered fuselage plug area at a property where it was recovered in Portland, Oregon.</span> Photograph: NTSB/Reuters</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Among them was the teenage boy moved next to Bartlett.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“His shirt got sucked off of his body when the panel blew out because of the pressure, and it was his seatbelt that kept him in his seat and saved his life. And there he was next to me,” she said, adding that his mother was reseated elsewhere.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We had our masks on, and the plane was really loud so we couldn’t talk. But I had a … notes app on my phone that I was typing on. So I typed to him and I asked him if he was hurt,” Bartlett said. “I just couldn’t believe he was sitting there and what he must have gone through, what he must have been feeling at the time.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>She said the boy typed back that he was OK, but a bit scratched, adding “that was unbelievable” and “thank you for your kindness.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The pilots and flight attendants have not made public statements and their names have not been released, but in interviews with National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators, they described how their training kicked in. The pilots focused on getting the plane quickly back to Portland and the flight attendants on keeping the passengers safe, and as calm as possible.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The actions of the flight crew were really incredible,” the NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, said at a Sunday night news conference. She described the scene inside the cabin during those first seconds as “chaos, very loud between the air and everything going on around them and it was very violent”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Bartlett echoed praise for the crew, saying the entire time she felt like the plane was under control even though the roaring wind was so loud she couldn’t hear the captain’s announcements.</p><figure id=c107cc44-04e7-4385-a343-e4d505aec4de data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The fuselage plug area of the plane is seen during its investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Portland.</span> Photograph: NTSB/Reuters</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The flight attendants really responded well to the situation. They got everyone safe and then they got themselves safe,” she said. “And then there was nothing to do but wait, right? We were just on our way down and it was just a normal descent. It felt normal.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Inside the cockpit, the pilot and co-pilot donned their oxygen masks and opened their microphone, but “communication was a serious issue” between them and the flight attendants because of the noise, Homendy said. The pilots retrieved an emergency handbook kept secure next to the captain’s seat.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The co-pilot contacted air traffic controllers, declaring an emergency and saying the plane needed to immediately descend to 10,000ft, the altitude where there is enough oxygen for everyone onboard to breathe.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>’We need to turn back to Portland,” she said in a calm voice that she maintained throughout the landing.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In the cabin, the flight attendants’ immediate focus was on the five unaccompanied minors in their care and the three infants being carried on their parents’ laps.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Were they safe? Were they secure? Did they have their seat belts on or their lap belts on? And did they have their masks on? And they did,” Homendy said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Some passengers began sending messages on social media to loved ones. One young woman said on TikTok that she was certain the plane would nosedive at any second and she wondered how her death would affect her mother, worrying that she would never recover from the sorrow.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>But she and others said the cabin remained surprisingly calm. One passenger, Evan Granger, who was sitting in front of the blowout, told NBC News that his “focus in that moment was just breathe into the oxygen mask and trust that the flight crew will do everything they can to keep us safe”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I didn’t want to look back and see what was happening,” he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The pilots circled the plane back to Portland. Video taken by those on board showed flight attendants moving down the aisle checking on passengers. City lights could be seen through the hole flickering past.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Evan Smith, an attorney traveling on the plane, told reporters the descent and landing were loud but smooth. When the plane touched down at Portland International about 20 minutes after it departed, the passengers broke into applause. Firefighters came down the aisle to check for injuries, but no one was seriously hurt.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“There were so many things that had to go right in order for all of us to survive,” Granger told NBC.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Homendy said that if the blowout had happened a few minutes later, after the plane reached cruising altitude, the accident might have become a tragedy.</p><figure id=dadced47-f72f-4738-9252-295c2aa82801 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Working iPhone found on side of road ‘likely’ fell from Alaska Airlines flightRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Bartlett’s mind also keeps returning to the what-ifs.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I’m glad that it is not any worse than it was – that’s all.
