Met:</strong> Hudson and Robinson fell hard and fast. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>They met in May 2000 at a party in N.Y.C.</a> and moved in together <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>four days</a> later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'd never been in love before," Robinson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> the following year. "We went to Central Park and we walked and talked all afternoon, and when she went to the rest room, I thought, 'Fuck me, life is never going to be the same again' … She moved in that weekend."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It happened really fast," Hudson, who was 20 at the time, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cosmopolitan</a>. "We were attached at the hip, and we still are. We instantly liked being with each other."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Newsmakers</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson recounted their Central Park date to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>. "He took me for a walk in the park and held my hand, and I thought, My God, I'm already in love with a man I don't think anybody's going to understand!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soon, Hudson was wearing a diamond engagement ring, though she'd "get so nervous about people seeing it." In October 2000 she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> that though she was wearing a blinding ring on the appropriate finger, she wasn't "getting married any time soon," adding, "Chris just really wanted to give me something that said, 'I want to spend the rest of our lives together.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She echoed that sentiment in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> profile, adding, "We're totally committed to each other, and that will never change unless something horrible happens."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Less than three months later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hudson and Robinson wed on New Year's Eve</a> in a 19th century-themed ceremony held at Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell's Aspen ranch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three years later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>the couple welcomed their first (and only) child</a> together: son Ryder Russell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> dressing alike, being weird, love, thoughts on monogamy</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You know how couples sort of start to look alike after a while? Well, no one expected sunny 20-year-old Kate Hudson would evolve into a rock star 12 years her senior.

Savi/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was rebellious … thoughtfully rebellious. He doesn't fit into any boxes," Hudson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cosmopolitan</a> when asked why she was initially attracted to Robinson. "And it was nice to be with somebody who liked to hold court. It's nice to be with somebody who likes to take over a room."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And yes, they shared clothing. "I love his old clothes from the '90s," Hudson admitted. "He weighed about five pounds in his 20s, and they fit me now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This was not your typical closed-door celebrity couple. Like Hudson's very brand, her relationship with Robinson felt authentic and honest — the subtext of every interview reading:"nothing to hide here!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At 23, Hudson was dispensing marital advice, proclaiming that she and Robinson "will never think of not being with each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I get kind of disappointed in people who don't take marriage seriously," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a>. "You shouldn't make the decision rashly. For us, we will never think of not being with each other. I'm done. I am happy. I can't wait to grow old. I can't wait to retire."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robinson appeared to be just as enthralled by his partner as Hudson was. "She has such a deep soul," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>. "I hate to spend any time away from her. I've never experienced something so easy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, there were noted valleys. In 2003, Hudson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> that the early days of their relationship were "volatile."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Scott Nelson/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were so in love and passionate, and then we would just hate each other and throw stuff around, and then we would travel to Paris for a week," she explained. Yes, same.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2006, about a year before news of Hudson and Robinson's impending divorce was made public, the actress told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a> that she didn't think monogamy was realistic. When asked whether she thought her husband cheated (inspired by mom Goldie Hawn's quote: "All men cheat"), Hudson said that if he did she wouldn't want to know.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If for some reason that's what he has to go do, I just don't want to know," she told Billy Bush. "As long as things are good in our house, please just don't get caught … To me there is nothing more attractive when I see my husband finding another woman attractive."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Hudson and Robinson were very candid about money, and how much of it they had …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On their very first date, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>they ventured into Barneys</a> (a natural first date destination) and Robinson offered to buy Hudson a coat she was interested in. It was $4,000. She ultimately bought it herself, as "it was only our first date." Perhaps more of a second date gift?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Somebody asked her the other day what her favorite accessory was," Robinson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>, joking, "I'll tell you her favorite accessory: a platinum American Express credit card!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> In August 2006, Hudson's rep confirmed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>she and Robinson had separated</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year later, Hudson opened up about the divorce in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper's Bazaar</a>, emphasizing that they were both committed to raising their son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Divorce is] really, really hard. And for both Chris and me, our main focus is, and was, Ryder. And happy parents, happy baby," she said, "And therefore, I love Chris to pieces. He's my first huge love. I spent seven years with Chris. I was 20 when I met him. We still talk every day. He still cracks me up. And Ryder feels that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2008, Hudson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Mail</a> that she and Robinson "had no animosity" in their breakup. "Chris and I divorced for the right reasons – we just didn't work. But we remain extremely close."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it appeared to be true … Later that year, in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cosmopolitan</a> (in which Robinson himself made a cameo), Hudson insisted that she "could never look at [our divorce] as a mistake," going as far as to call it "the best thing that ever happened to us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson went on to date <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Owen Wilson</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dax Shepard</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Alex Rodriguez</a> before welcoming son Bingham with Muse frontman Matt Bellamy. The actress is currently dating musician Danny Fujikawa, with whom she shares daughter Rani, 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next up for the actress is thriller Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon and Shriver opposite Michael Shannon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robinson wed Allison Bridges in 2009 and welcomed daughter Cheyenne that same year.
