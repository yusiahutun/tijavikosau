Attorney'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The lawyer said Blackwell's decision to livestream was to 'bravely expose the deep-seated issues that plague society,' but the police and local media failed to engage in what could have been a 'meaningful dialogue' about the causes of the unrest.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mann called the looters 'individuals driven by pain and anguish' and said the robbery 'is not about sneakers or alcohol.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It is about the systemic oppression that has plagued our communities for generations... and the corrosive effects of unchecked police brutality and a justice system that favors the powerful over the voiceless,' the lawyer added.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the end of the letter, Mann called the city of Philadelphia to 'take responsibility for creating a system' that allows police brutality.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When officers can murder with impunity, when communities are left to suffer without resources, it is no wonder that people feel compelled to take matters into their own hands,' she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While some supported the sentiment, others pointed out that the charges were brought against her for participating in a crime spree, among which dozens were arrested.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If she had stayed home, minded her business and not incite folks, she would not be in the situation she is in and have charges pending against her,' one of Mann's followers said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'No matter how much y'all
