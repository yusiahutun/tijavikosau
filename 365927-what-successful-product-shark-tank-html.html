The ‘Sharks’ can only invest their money if they are convinced that the product or business will be successful. Many businesses have been turned down on this show, and even though some did not become successful as the ‘Sharks’ had predicted, some went on to flourish without investment from this show. The most successful product on Shark Tank has made millions of dollars in profit and made even more entrepreneurs to follow this path.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/347860fc93f7c9cf.png><p class=align-left>Shark Tank premiered in 2009, and in the last decade, the show has made a kill out of making businesses. Upcoming entrepreneurs pitch their product ideas to a panel of potential investors made of Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner (Queen of QVC), and acerbic Kevin O’Leary. The idea is that if the product is good, it will be encouraged, and investment capital will be provided. On the other hand, questionable inventions are scorned, and owners are sent back to the drawing board.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/25d7d7d442c7cc2b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Cohen's net worth: Chewy, GameStop, house, investments</span></p></a><h2>The most successful product on Shark Tank</h2><p class=align-left>Investors are some of the wealthiest people in the world. Therefore, they tend to handpick only the products that are worth their time. Many deals don’t go beyond the due diligence stage, and very few go on to succeed. The following are the most successful products:</p><h3>1. Bombas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/25d7d7d442c7cc2b.jpg><p class=align-left>When it comes to the best Shark Tank products, Bombas will always be among the most successful. The owners of Bombas appeared on Shark Tank in season 6 in 2014, seeking a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$200,000 capital</a> for which John was given a 17% stake in the business. The enterprise went on to make about $225 million in lifetime sales.</p><p class=align-left>The co-founders of this venture are David Heath and Randy Goldberg, who pride themselves in creating very comfortable socks.
