by noting that he and Edward started "dating" again "about a month" after Lewis and his on-again-off-again boyfriend Scott Anderson split. "We went on probably about 12 dates," Lewis said, adding that he and Edward "spent a lot of time" with their 4-year-old daughter, Monroe.</p><p>The Bravo star said he waited to discuss reconnecting with his ex on his radio show because he "didn't really know what it was" -- and added, "I wanted us to kind of quietly figure it out."</p><p>Ultimately, he added, "It didn't work out."</p><p>"So basically what happened was, we were seeing each other for about three months," he explained. "I want to say it was like 12 dates, a couple of sleepovers, lots of dinners and breakfast with Monroe and all of that. It was cool. I was having a great time. I felt like, 'Wow, maybe my family is coming back together.' I was having a nice time. I thought we were doing well."</p><p>Lewis said he feels like he's "a better communicator" now than he was in the past, noting that he put in the "work" during the two years that he and Edward weren't together. However, according to Jeff, Gage hadn't changed and "started pulling away" and "was very hot and cold" when they reunited.</p><p>"I didn't get mad. I didn't get passive-aggressive," he said. "I just was like flat out, 'Hey, can I talk to you? I feel like you're being very selective with your attention and your affection. It feels very hot and cold. I'm feeling rejected.' I mean, I was like, 'Who is this guy?'"</p><p>In the past, Lewis said he would have wanted an answer right away, but he said he was "cool" in the situation. "I said, 'Look, it's a lot of information. Just marinade on it and then get back to me and let's discuss it,'" he continued. "Three days later, 'I think we should just be friends.' That's what I got."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:28bada74-20ba-4466-be06-145992ddbe68 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73c1d357-6106-4dfa-a49a-587a3450c538 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b0/5by4/2021/01/25/b0162b080812432bb5a8432ae4ade577_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jeff Lewis and Boyfriend Scott Anderson Split Again ... for the Fourth Time</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Lewis said he told Edward that he "was a little shocked" because he thought it "was going well" between them.</p><p>"He said, 'Actually, you know, there's a few times that you triggered me,'" Lewis claimed, "and I said, 'Well, I wouldn't know what those triggers are because you never communicated with me. And had you communicated with me, we could have discussed it in the moment ... maybe I needed to adjust my behavior.'"</p><p>Addressing his guest, psychotherapist Dr. Donna Dannenfelser, who had asked him what he ultimately learned, Lewis said, "You told me from the very beginning that if, when this kind of situation happens, you have to start a new relationship."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ab8b22ff-0947-4cc6-8e0b-dc351cb5c134 data-container-ref=toofab:article:73c1d357-6106-4dfa-a49a-587a3450c538 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e7/5by4/2020/10/07/e72a612976854c84a20ec82295cbceb1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jeff Lewis Details Run-In with Jenni Pulos After Flipping Out Falling Out</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"He did a lot of s----- f---ing things to me," he continued, starting to get heated. "And you know what? I was willing to forget, forgive and start over. But the reality is he's not willing to forget. He's not willing to start. He's still hanging on to every f---ing thing I ever did."</p><p>"The other thing too is I've apologized for the 6,000 things that I have done in the last 12 years in detail," he added.</p><p>The two split back in 2019 and have been embroiled in a nasty battle over custody ever since, with Lewis often taking swipes at Edward on his show, and Gage filing lawsuits against Jeff. Back in May, the former couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/2021/05/20/jeff-lewis-gage-edward-custody-battle/>finally settled</a> their custody dispute after a nasty, 26-month-long battle. While Lewis and Edward clearly aren't together now, Jeff said the "good news" to come out of the situation is that they were "able to kind of heal" from their legal war.</p><a id=gallery-link-0fde553f-e03a-4cc2-91ea-503b565fc4ca class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0fde553f-e03a-4cc2-91ea-503b565fc4ca data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:73c1d357-6106-4dfa-a49a-587a3450c538 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/4by3/2021/07/19/c047dd9e7de64db883029a8b7c284125_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3Bma2lfn7KnsoylnLCho2K%2FpsLEmqOsZZiaeqi702aZmpubYsGws8Stn56qXZyuqLGMnpuwmaKZeqW1w6erZq%2Bfp7huu9StZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meet-hugh-hefner-first-wife-millie-williams-where-is-she-now-untold-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meet Hugh Hefner First Wife Millie Williams.
