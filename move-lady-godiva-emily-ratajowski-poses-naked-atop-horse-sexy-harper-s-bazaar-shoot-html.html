her husband, using her sexuality for political purpose.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:14.4px>So it's not hard to see why Emily would draw comparisons to the Countess,

In March, Kim Kardashian — a woman Emily admitted she didn't know personally at the time — shared a nude selfie on her Instagram account, which drew mixed reactions from the public.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'There was this uproar, especially from Piers Morgan, who wrote this whole thing about "she's a mother, she's 35, it's ridiculous…She's too old and she's a mother, and we've given her enough attention, like she needs to stop doing this." That made me really angry... Kim's allowed to do what she wants.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:14.4px></span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/07/14/360A754F00000578-0-image-a-14_1467896780553.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Dressing?
