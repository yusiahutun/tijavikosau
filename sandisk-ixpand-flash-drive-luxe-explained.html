Especially if you throw Windows® into the mix as well. Sure, technology is great, but when you have several operating systems on the go at once, for different purposes, things can become somewhat disparate, and quickly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>One device that wants to bridge the gap between your hardware is the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe from Western Digital®; a flash drive with a neat trick hidden up its proverbial sleeve.</p><p>Keen to know more about how the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe can port your data smoothly between devices? Read on...</p><h2 id=what-is-sandisk-39-s-ixpand-flash-drive-luxe>What Is SanDisk's iXpand Flash Drive Luxe?</h2><p>You're probably wondering why we're making such a fuss over a flash drive. Well, your data porting woes are about to become a distant memory, as the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe allows you to connect your flash drive directly to any compatible device with either a lightning connector <strong>OR </strong>even a USB Type-CTM port. So, you can connect it to compatible iPhone and Samsung Galaxy® devices, for example, and transfer files between the two quickly and easily.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>How does this work? Simple; SanDisk has designed the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe with not one, but two connectors. You have a Lightning connector for Apple devices, and a USB Type-C connector for USB Type-C smartphones, tablets including the latest iPad tablets and USB Type-C computers. This way, you can connect your iXpand Flash Drive Luxe to many of the latest mobile devices and tablets.</p><p>The device comes in 64, 128, or 264 GB[1] capacities, and retail starts at $39.99 for the 64 GB version. You can buy it now from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Western Digital store</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>[1] 1GB = 1 billion bytes, 1TB = 1 trillion bytes. Actual user capacity may be less depending on operating environment.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-sandisk-39-s-ixpand-flash-drive-luxe-help-control-data-between-devices>How Does the SanDisk's iXpand Flash Drive Luxe Help Control Data Between Devices?</h2><p>The SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe has several key features that enable you to streamline your data porting process between your devices.</p><h2 id=multiple-connections>1. Multiple Connections</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iXpand-flash-disk-luxe-connections.jpg><p>The iXpand Flash Drive Luxe is your best friend for managing data between your devices. This is thanks to the two integrated connectors at either end of the device: one for Apple's Lightning connections, and the other for any USB Type-C device, including Android smartphones! This immediately streamlines the process; you just plug the drive into your device with the right connector. Easy!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>No messing around with adaptors to convert your Lightning connector to a USB Type-C or vice versa, either. This is great because those adaptors are always small and easy to lose, in which instance you're left with a device that can only do half of its duties. Not the case with the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe; the connectors are available on the drive itself at all times, so you don't need to worry about losing small, loose components.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=transfer-your-files-fast>2. Transfer Your Files, Fast</h2><p>If you are concerned about read/write speeds, don't be; the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe is more than capable of transferring data as quick as a flash (drive). No more hanging around while you transfer files from one smartphone to another via Bluetooth® or fidgeting around with phone settings to enable Nearby Share. You just plug the drive into your source device and transfer files in an instant.</p><p>As you can imagine, this is pretty rapid when you think about the size of the files on your smartphone or tablet. Even large files will transfer quickly and without interruption, unlike a wireless transfer, which is subject to numerous external variables that can affect file transfer speeds.</p><h2 id=your-data-is-protected-physically>3. Your Data Is Protected Physically...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iXpand-flash-disk-luxe-with-iphone-and-android-phone.jpg><p>The design of your SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe doesn't come with cheap-feeling, easily broken housing. Instead, SanDisk has gone the extra mile to ensure that your new storage device has a premium feel to it, thanks to the all-metal chassis the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe boasts.</p><p>Luxury aside, you have the obvious protection benefits of a metal case, here.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=and-digitally>4. ... And Digitally</h2><p>SanDisk knows that you probably don't want just <strong>anyone</strong> to view the files on your drive. This makes sense; your photos, videos, and whatever else is on your source device are <strong>your</strong> memories, and you don't need other people being privy to that, especially if you are transferring sensitive data, like work reports or financial details.</p><p>This is why you can protect the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe with a password. That way, you have an added layer of security, and you know the only people who will see your files are you and the people you transfer them to. Nobody else will get a look in (as long as you pick a strong password, of course).</p><h2 id=free-up-space-easily>5. Free Up Space Easily</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sandisk-ixpand-with-smartphone-2.jpg><p>Everyone uses their smartphone as a camera, camcorder, voice recorder, and whatever else your device is capable of, which is a lot! With that in mind, we all know the old "Insufficient Storage" situation, when we want to download a crucial app and there is no room on our smartphone. Cue rushed deletion of countless files to free up space.</p><p>This is a thing of the past with the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe. You just plug it into your phone, and transfer your files across, freeing up space in an instant. You can then quickly and easily transfer them to your PC and back them up to the cloud. So, your memories stay put, and your smartphone has plenty of storage again.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=pocket-sized-portability>6. Pocket-Sized Portability</h2><p>Given that this is a USB drive, the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe is eminently portable. At only 1.96 x 0.62 x 0.35 inches, it is hardly going to take up much real estate in your pocket or bag. Plus, this means you don't need to lug around a heavier external drive, which is great if you're taking lots of smartphone pictures and videos for a project. Just grab the drive out of your pocket or bag, transfer your files, then carry on shooting.</p><p>A swivel case covers the body of the drive, so you just flip the case around, depending on which connector you need to use at the time. The connector outside the swiveling case has a cap to protect it, so you don't need to worry about throwing it into your backpack or laptop bag when you're done with it. The drive also features a keyring hole, letting you easily attach it to a larger item so it’s less likely to get lost.</p><h2 id=a-dedicated-app>7. A Dedicated App</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iXpand-flash-disk-luxe-connected-to-iphone.jpg><p>The iXpand Flash Drive Luxe boasts its own dedicated app for <a href=#>iOS</a>, with features that allow you to transfer files quickly and easily. Given the two connection types, you are probably wondering whether Android has a dedicated app. It doesn't, but as long as your Android device support OTG (on-the-go) USB Type-C connections, you'll be fine using your phone’s native files app. If Android users prefer to use a SanDisk app to access your drive’s contents, which would also enable you to back up your phone, the <a href=#>SanDisk® Memory Zone</a>TM app is available.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The apps allow you to instantly view your files and select those which you'd like to transfer with a tap of your finger. No rooting around iOS system menus, you simply plug your drive into your iPhone, launch the app, and you can begin transferring files seamlessly from your phone to the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe.</p><h2 id=why-not-try-the-sandisk-ixpand-flash-drive-luxe-for-yourself>Why Not Try the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe for Yourself?</h2><p>With seamless file transfer between mobile devices just a whisker away, all you need to do now is head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Western Digital</a>® store and snap up an iXpand for yourself. With a truly portable, versatile, and connectable device by your side, your file sharing woes can become a thing of the past.</p><p>The ease with which you can use SanDisk's on-the-go workhorse makes it an excellent investment, and more than worthy of your consideration in respect of a quick and easy way to transfer and store files from your iOS and Android devices.</p><p>Western Digital, the Western Digital logo, SanDisk, the SanDisk logo, SanDisk iXpand, and Memory Zone are registered trademarks or trademarks of Western Digital Corporation or its affiliates in the US and/or other countries.
