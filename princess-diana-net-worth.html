According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Harry and William inherited part of their mother’s estate on their 25th birthdays, which was around $10 million each. In a CBS interview with Oprah Winfrey and his wife, Meghan Markle, in March 2021, Harry revealed that he used his trust from his mother to support him and his family after his father, Prince Charles, cut him off financially at the start of 2020 following Harry and Meghan’s exit from the British royal family and move to the United States.&nbsp;“I had to afford security for us,” Harry said at the time. “[I was cut off] in the first quarter of 2020. But I’ve got what my mom left me and without that, we would not have been able to do this.”</p><p>According to Us Weekly, though Diana’s will stated that her estate would be distributed to William and Harry when they turned 25, the funds were held until they were 30. Despite the hold, the brothers were still able to receive interest on their trust funds earlier.&nbsp;While Harry and William were the chief heirs of Diana’s estate, the People’s Princess’ will also listed others whom she wanted to share her wealth, including her butler, Paul Burrell, as well as 17 of her godchildren, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Worthy</a>.</p><h2>What was Princess Diana’s net worth?</h2><p>So…what was Princess Diana’s net worth at the time of her death? Princess Diana’s net worth was $25 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a> reported in 1996 that Princess Diana received $22.5 million in cash after she and Prince Charles divorced in August 1996 after five years of marriage. The number is less than a third of the $75 million she asked for in their divorce. The newspaper also reported that Diana’s divorce settlement included $600,000 per to maintain her office.</p><p>Before her divorce, Diana’s money would come from her marriage. As the Duke of Cornwall, Charles’ income comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, a trust that was founded by Edward III in the 14th century to keep his first-born son—Edward, the Black Prince—occupied as he waited to become king, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>. The magazine reports that the duchy, which is worth almost $1.3 billion, has a staff of 150 people, who manage more than 130,000 acres of property across southwest England. Charles also can’t sell assets belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall, however, he can earn money from them. Forbes reports that the Duchy brought in $50 million in 2020 by renting out property to retailers, farmers and residents—$30 of which went to Prince Charles and his descendants.</p><p>Charles also receives money from the Sovereign Grant, a.k.a. the Crown Estate, which brought in $700 million in 2019 and more than $475 million in profits, according to Forbes. The British royal family receives 25 percent of the Sovereign Grant, which came out to around $120 million to the royals in 2020, according to Forbes. That money is used for official expenses, such as payroll, security, travel, housekeeping, maintenance costs and IT expenses. Forbes reports that the Sovereign Grant paid Charles less than $2.5 million in 2020.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Spare-by-Prince-Harry.jpeg></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$23.12</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$36.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>36% Off</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For more about Prince Harry, read his upcoming memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span class=s2><i>Spare</i></span></a>.

She was 36 years old. Her rumored boyfriend, Egyptian businessman Emad “Dodi” Fayed, and the driver of the Mercedes-Benz W140, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. Diana’s bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, survived the crash with serious injuries. Diana, who was still alive at the scene of the crash but was in critical condition, was rushed to the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital where she died. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine, Diana suffered from a concussion, a broken arm, a cut thigh and massive chest injuries. After a two-hour operation to save her, the doctors failed to get Diana’s heart to beat properly and she never regained consciousness. She died from internal bleeding at 4:53 a.m. on August 31, 1997.</p><p>Diana and Fayed, who arrived in Paris after a 10-day getaway on the French Riviera, got into Paul’s car a few minutes after midnight on August 31, 1997, before their car crashed. It’s believed that Diana and Fayed planned to travel to Fayed’s private estate in Paris. According to Oprah magazine, the posted speed limit for the road for 30 miles per hour, however, Paul approached the entrance of the tunnel at around 70 miles per hour, which led him to lose control of the car and collide with a pillar in the middle of the highway. According to a report by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Telegraph</a> at the time, a French investigation found that Paul, who was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz, had been intoxicated by alcohol and under the effects of prescription drugs, including anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs, at the time of the crash. The investigation found that he was solely responsible for the accident. Investigations also revealed that Rees-Jones survived because he was wearing a seatbelt, while no one else in the car was wearing one.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Diana-Her-True-Story-In-Her-Own-Words.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$10.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$20.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>45% Off</span></p><p>For more about Princess Diana, read Andrew Morton’s biography,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Diana: Her True Story — In Her Words</a>.
