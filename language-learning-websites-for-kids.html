Whether it's understanding other cultures, the freedom to communicate when traveling, or greater job opportunities, the benefits of learning another language can't be overstated.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There are plenty of great websites to help children learn a foreign language. If you want to support your child's school curriculum, or help them to pick up another language in their spare time, fun online resources can aid in the process.</p><p>We've rounded up some of the best websites to help children learn another language.</p><h2 id=bbc-bitesize>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Bitesize</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bbc-bitesize-french.jpg><p>The BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster in the UK that offers a wealth of <a href=#>incredible online learning resources for children</a> of all ages. It provides lessons for French, Gaelic, German, Irish, Mandarin, Spanish, and Welsh. It follows the UK curriculum, but the content within is helpful for any language learner.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Each subject splits into topics (like weather, numbers, and hobbies) with written and audiovisual guidance. At the end of each topic, children can take a quiz to assess how they're doing. There is also craft activities, songs and stories, and cultural information.</p><p>Depending on the age of your child, you may need to support them through the lessons to help keep them engaged and offer feedback.</p><h2 id=dinolingo>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dinolingo</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dinolingo.jpg><p>Whatever language your child wants to learn, chances are that Dinolingo offers it. There are over 50 to choose from, including Chinese, Japanese, Polish, Swedish, and Ukrainian, aimed at those between ages three and 14.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Colorful animations bring the lessons to life, which are taught through the immersion method. This means no translation; instead, children learn purely through what they see and hear with their native tongue. There are videos, games, songs, worksheets, flashcards, and more to enjoy.</p><p>In a way, Dinolingo is <a href=#>edutainment that your children will enjoy playing</a>. That's because it rewards children with stars, points, and even dinosaurs, which they can use to track their progress. It's also something fun to work towards.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Dinolingo costs $14.95/month per language course, and that includes unlimited access for up to four children. There is no annual subscription.</p><h2 id=mylingokids>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyLingoKids</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mylingokids.jpg><p>MyLingoKids is a foreign language learning platform for children aged three to 17. It connects your child with a certified language tutor who is fluent in English and native to the language they teach. Languages on offer include German, Spanish, Chinese, and Greek.</p><p>All the lessons take place over Skype, with MyLingoKids providing materials, exercises, and progress tracking. This immediate, engaging setting means that children remain focused on their learning, and can stick to a schedule. Parents have full control over their child's profile so that they can monitor their learning.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>MyLingoKids offers a free trial lesson. After this, you must buy lessons in bulk, and the cost varies depending on lesson length (30 minutes or an hour) and learning level. If your child doesn't get on with their tutor (though MyLingoKids assures this is rare), they can switch to someone else.</p><h2 id=muzzy>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Muzzy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/muzzy.jpg><p>Muzzy began life in 1986, as a television film created by the BBC to teach English as a second language. Now, Muzzy and his animal friends live online and teach a range of languages like Spanish, French, German, and Italian through exciting animated stories.</p><p>The course provides hundreds of games, vocabulary builder activities, worksheets, flashcards, and songs. Children of all ages will benefit from Muzzy, which offers a fun and humorous approach to language learning and provides the foundation they need—like telling the time, asking questions, days of the week, and so on.</p><p>Muzzy is purchasable as a rolling subscription. It's $30 for three months, $75 for 12 months, and $95 for 24 months. Each come with a 30-day 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=petralingua>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PetraLingua</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/petralingua.jpg><p>PetraLingua has been creating language learning resources for children for over 15 years. The company offers courses in Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Chinese, accompanied by an assortment of colorful characters.</p><p>PetraLingua aims to teach children aged three to ten. The courses are packed with songs, videos, games, activity books, alongside other resources like a talking picture dictionary. Everything is designed to be fun, visual, and engaging, which is why many of the activities are interactive.</p><p>Each language costs $7.99/month. You can save money by paying in advance for three, six, or 12 months. PetraLingua also sells physical products through its store like DVDs, books, and hand puppets, which you might wish to purchase to accompany the course, though it isn't essential.</p><h2 id=rosetta-stone>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosetta Stone</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rosetta-stone.jpg><p>Rosetta Stone is one of the most popular language learning websites. When looking to learn a new language, many people <a href=#>compare Duolingo against Rosetta Stone</a>. Both make for good choices, but if your child is learning a language at school, it's quite possible the school uses Rosetta Stone.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>As such, consider buying a subscription to Rosetta Stone to further your child's language learning at home. Unlike the other websites we've covered, Rosetta Stone is a bit more serious, so it's better targeted at older children capable of learning alone, or as a support resource for you to teach your child.</p><p>It offers 25 languages and teaches through immersive real-world scenarios, along with providing immediate feedback and the potential to receive live coaching. For access to one language, it costs $35.97 for three months or $95.88 for a year. Alternatively, consider the $179 one-off purchase for access to all languages.</p><h2 id=open-up-a-world-of-possibilities-through-language-learning>Open Up a World of Possibilities Through Language Learning</h2><p>Many of the websites we've listed here also offer companion apps included in the cost of the service, meaning your child can take their learning from the desktop on the go. It makes sense, considering most youngsters are more used to dabbling with technology in their hands rather than at a desk.</p><p>Consistency is important when learning anything, but especially a language—let your child immerse themselves in it and they'll be speaking another language in no time. Perhaps they could even teach you?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGijmqaXqq6osYylnJqqnp67qHnWnpmsoaSawG6yzqtkpKGUqHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pride-as-a-positive-emotion.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Psychology of Pride and Its Positive Side</a>
